<li><!-- Expires 10 June 2025 -->
<p>
US citizens:
<a href="https://actionnetwork.org/letters/show-impact-of-tariffs-on-price-tags/?nowrapper=true">call
on several major US stores</a> to state on product labels how much of
the price is due to <a class="glossary"
href="/glossary.html#bully">the bully's</a> tariff decrees.
<p>
Here's how to make the actionnetwork.org letter campaign linked above
work without running the site's nonfree JavaScript code.
(See https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html.)
<p>
First, make sure you have deactivated JavaScrupt in your browser or
are using the LibreJS plug-in.
<p>
I have done the next step for you: I added `?nowrapper=true' to the
end of the campaign URL before posting it above.  That should bring
you to a page that starts with, "Letter campaigns will not work
without JavaScript!"
<p>
They indeed won't work without some manual help, but the following
simple method seems adequate for many of them, including this one.
<p>
To start, fill in the personal information answers in the box on the
right side of the page.  That's how you say who's sending the letter.
<p>
Then click the "START WRITING" button.  That will take you to a page
that can't function without nonfree JavaScript code.  (To ensure it
doesn't function perversely _by running_ that nonfree code, you can
enable LibreJS or disable JavaScript by visiting that page.)  You can
finish sending without that code By editing its URL in the browser's
address bar, as follows:
<p>
First, go to the end and insert `&nowrapper=true'.  Then tell the
browser to visit that URL.  This should give you a version of the page
that works without JavaScript.  Edit the subject and body of your
letter.  Finally, click on the "SEND LETTER" button, and you're done.
<p>
This method seems to work for letter campaigns that send the letters
to a fixed list of recipients, the same recipients for every sender.
Editing and revisiting the URL is the only additional step needed to
bypass the nonfree JavaScript code.  I'm sure you'll agree it is a
small effort for the result of supporting the campaign
without opening your computer to unjust (and potentially malicious)
software.



<p>
<li><!-- Expires 06 June 2025 -->
<p>
US citizens: phone your senators and urge them to reject injustices
in the Republicans' Big Bad Bill
<p>
One injustice is
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2025-mar-jun.html#28_May_2025_(Big_bad_bill_making_court_orders_unenforceable)">making court orders unenforceable</a>
&mdash; so <a class="glossary" href="/glossary.html#bully">the bully</a>
could brush aside those impediments to absolute power.
<p>
Another injustice is the cuts in medicine and food aid for
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2025-mar-jun.html#28_May_2025_(Big_Bill_in_US_Senate_dire,_perilous)">Americans who can't afford it</a>.
<p>
And then there are the tax cuts for the rich.  (The rest of this email
I have copied from a message which suggested running nonfree software.
I can't refer the public to that!)
<p>
Republicans know these tax cuts are wildly unpopular, so they’re   
scrambling to rebrand. Speaker Mike Johnson trimmed the plan   
slightly and Trump floated a tiny rate increase for ultra-high   
earners both designed to generate positive press.    
<p>
But don’t be fooled, this is still a massive giveaway to the   
billionaire class:    
<ul>
<li> Trump’s revised plan still delivers hundreds of billions to   
  billionaires    
<li> Just 800 billionaires (out of 130 million households, that’s the   
  top 0.000006%) control more wealth than the bottom 50% of   
  American households combined.    
<li> Investment income &mdash; the main source of wealth for the richest   
  &mdash; is still shielded from fair taxation    
<li> There's still no tax on wealth &mdash; despite its increasingly   
  extreme concentration    
</ul>   
We need a tax system that serves all of us, not just the   
wealthiest few. That means closing loopholes, taxing wealth, and   
investing in the public good: affordable healthcare, strong   
schools, safe communities, and a government that reflects the will   
of the people.

Insructions in a nutshell:

Only 4 list items are wanted here.  If you add a new list item to the top of
this file, then please *move* the oldest list item at the bottom over to:

Thanks.

Here is the detailed version.

The list items in this file are presented on the main page of stallman.org,
/index.html.  So it shouldn't take up too much page space.  Four texts is the
current desired limit. 

New texts should be added to this file at the top of the list 
as new list items with an id attribute of your choosing.

Old list items should then be subtracted from the bottom of this list, and moved
from here to the top of the list in /there-ought-to-be-a-law.html.  

No info is lost. The stallman.org URL 

    /there-ought-to-be-a-law.html

links to the whole version, the master list of laws that ought to be.  It
renders the entire list because it is set up to transclude the list items in
this file:

    /common/ought-to-be-a-law.html
    
putting the items in this file at the top.

The front page offers the link text "More items where there ought to be a law".
This takes you to the whole version. When viewed in your text editor, then:

      *   Abandoned coalmines and oil and gas wells are now one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/07/abandoned-infrastructure-one-of-the-biggest-polluters-in-the-world-report">biggest sources</a>
      of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, new data shows, and
      little effort is being made to clean them up.*
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect that the fossil fuel companies to divest themselves from old
      mines and wells in ways that will avoid liability for them &mdash; just as
      they sometimes <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2015-sep-dec.html#8_October_2015_(Patriot_Coal)">disconnect themselves from responsibility</a> for
      supporting former workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I suggest making it a felony to implement a restructuring of
      business or assets in a way that is likely to result predictably in
      strand assets that carry financial responsibilities with no one
      capable of shouldering the responsibilities.

      A pitifully weak attempt to solve a real problem: asking for a federal
law that would permit victims of domestic abuse and stalking to <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/data-brokers-harm-abuse-survivors-we-need-a-law-to-stop-them">demand
    that data brokers delete information about them</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
Data, once collected, <em>will</em> be abused.  The way to prevent that abuse is to
facilitate refusing to hand it over in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
Here is my proposal for protecting the specific people known to be in
particular danger, and everyone else who could be harmed if
individuals, businesses or governments use their personal data
against them without a search warrant: require services to be available
anonymously.

  <li id="toxic-chemicals">
    The regulation of toxic chemicals in the US is hamstrung by laws that
    enable companies to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/17/lawsuit-prevent-hiding-toxic-chemicals">keep their use and their presence in any place
      secret</a>.
    <p>
      The selfish interest of those who keep trade secrets is rational but
      antisocial.  In many cases the only harm it does is to hold back the
      general advance of technology.  But sometimes it does really nasty
      things.  For digital hardware and software, it often gives companies a
      way to subjugate their users.  Regarding use of toxic chemicals, it
      endangers public health.
    <p>
      Why would legislators pass laws to "protect" companies instead of
      protecting the people they harm?  I suspect it is partly because these
      companies are influential and the legislators seek their support,
      and partly because the legislators ask them for campaign funds.
    <p>
      But it is also partly the result of the mindset of "trickle down", which
      assumes that the only way to get more funds for the state is to
      let increase the size of the economy by letting companies have what
      they want.  Unfortunately, what they want is often to be allowed to
      harm the public.
    <p>
      Most Democrats in Congress got corrupted this way in the 80s and 90s.
      (The exceptions are the progressive Democrats.)  Now in the UK
      Starmer is guiding Labour into that sort of corruption.
    <p>
      Clearly our laws should say that any public need to know about the
      presence of toxic substances in a business facility overrides the
      desire to keep them secret.

    *China-owned British Steel said to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/23/china-owned-british-steel-requested-600m-taxpayer-support">requested &pound;600m of taxpayer
      support</a>.*
    <p>
      Whether the owners are Chinese is a question that there is no need to
      ask, because the state should <em>never</em> give money to a business "to
      support it."
      Instead it should offer to lend money to the company for suitable
      repayment, or else buy equity at a fair price.
    <p>
      These two ways of supporting a company avoid giving the owners an
      opporunity to rip off the state -- which the company's owners are likely
      to try to do, if they can, regardless of which country they are from.
    <p>
      With a policy like this, it wouldn't matter which country the
      company's owners are from.

<p>
Here's how to make the actionnetwork.org letter campaign linked above
work without running the site's nonfree JavaScript code.
(See https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html.)
<p>
First, make sure you have deactivated JavaScrupt in your browser or
are using the LibreJS plug-in.
<p>
I have done the next step for you: I added `?nowrapper=true' to the
end of the campaign URL before posting it above.  That should bring
you to a page that starts with, "Letter campaigns will not work
without JavaScript!"
<p>
They indeed won't work without some manual help, but the following
simple method seems adequate for many of them, including this one.
<p>
To start, fill in the personal information answers in the box on the
right side of the page.  That's how you say who's sending the letter.
<p>
Then click the "START WRITING" button.  That will take you to a page
that can't function without nonfree JavaScript code.  (To ensure it
doesn't function perversely <em>by running</em> that nonfree code, you can
enable LibreJS or disable JavaScript by visiting that page.)  You can
finish sending without that code By editing its URL in the browser's
address bar, as follows:
<p>
First, go to the end and insert `&nowrapper=true'.  Then tell the
browser to visit that URL.  This should give you a version of the page
that works without JavaScript.  Edit the subject and body of your
letter.  Finally, click on the "SEND LETTER" button, and you're done.
<p>
This method seems to work for letter campaigns that send the letters
to a fixed list of recipients, the same recipients for every sender.
Editing and revisiting the URL is the only additional step needed to
bypass the nonfree JavaScript code.  I'm sure you'll agree it is a
small effort for the result of supporting the campaign
without opening your computer to unjust (and potentially malicious)
software.

<h3>No national identity cards</h3>
<p>
I'd like to make a list of countries that do not require a national
identity card, and have no plans to adopt one. If you live in or have
confirmed knowledge of such a country, please send email to rms at
gnu.org.

<p>
Here's my list of countries with no national ID cards
and no plans for one: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK.
Australia's previous government tried to
institute national ID cards, but the Labor government dropped
the plan.</p>

<p>India has mostly finished imposing a national biometric ID number
in a grand act of oppression.
</p>

<p>Switzerland has national ID cards which are optional,
but they or some other government ID card are needed for some purposes.
<p>
Iceland doesn't have ID cards as such, but they
have ID numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently.
For example, the national ID number is often required to
rent a video or use a gym.
</p>

<p>
Denmark issues non-photo ID cards with a "person number", and many
services use this card to identify people.
</p>

<p>
Norway will impose a national
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Norwegian_citizens_now_required_by_law_to_give_their_fingerprint_to_the_police.html">biometric
ID card</a>.

<h3>The Lifelong Activist</h3>
<p>
People often ask how I manage to continue devoting myself to
progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for
years without burning out.  The best way I can answer is by
recommending a book, <a href="https://hillaryrettigproductivity.com/the-lifelong-activist/">
The Lifelong Activist</a> by Hillary Rettig.

<p>I disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last
part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as
<em>being</em> marketing and sales, because those terms refer to
business, and politics is something much more
important than mere business.  However, this doesn't diminish
the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing
techniques from marketing and sales.</p>
