The act of male attraction is treated as if it has value.

It is also treated like it's self justifying.

It's more about claiming power,

the suicidal urge men have when they see a woman who their attraction to means nothing, they are being deprived power.

This is a similar feeling, I think, to how a defanged snake must feel.
