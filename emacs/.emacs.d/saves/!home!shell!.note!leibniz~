God's expression through objects.

Cases such as an ellipse expressing a circle, or even a map expressing a piece of land, seem to fit well with this understanding of expression

Leibniz also talks about speech expressing thought, about an equation expressing a figure, about substances expressing the universe, about substances expressing God, and about God expressing “everything at once, the possible and the actual, past, present, and future” (WF: 118)
