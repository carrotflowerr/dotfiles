Dao De Jing by Lao Zi

 

A Minimalist Translation

 

By Bruce R. Linnell, PhD

 

2015

 

Welcome to yet another translation of the Dao De Jing (DDJ), or Tao Te
Ching in the old-fashioned spelling.  Why should you want to read this
translation?  This version attempts to include an exact translation of
every Chinese symbol in the original text, with as few added words and
paraphrasing as possible.  This results in sentences which hopefully
provide a more literal translation, but are bare and minimalist,
sometimes awkward, and often doesn’t make sense.  You, the reader, will
have to wrestle with some sentences, trying to wring out of them
whatever meaning their author was trying to express 2300 years ago,
instead of my simply telling you what I think they mean.  I also show
you what words were translated exactly, what was interpreted, and what
was added or left out, so you can see exactly how much the English
translation has in common with the original Chinese.  I even point out
alternative translations, so you can choose for yourself in some cases. 

 

Another difference is that while this translation is primarily based on
the “Wang Bi” ancient manuscript (used by most translators), it presents
some of the ideas from the earliest versions of the DDJ we have
available, if those ideas are present in the majority of all the
sources.

 

Finally, scholars have long speculated that different parts of the DDJ
were written by different authors at different times.  By analyzing the
symbols, phrases, and themes in each chapter, the chapters can be
separated into at least three groups.  The appendix presents the
chapters in these groups, so that the reader may better see the common
themes each group focused on.

==============================================================

 

Who Wrote the DDJ and When?

 

There is a great deal of debate over these questions, enough to fill a
book in their own right!  What follows is just a very brief introduction
for the first-time reader who has no idea who “Lao Zi” was (please note
that all dates are very approximate).

 

Although the author of the DDJ is always given as “Lao Zi” or “Lao Tsu”
(old spelling), we have no historical proof of his existence.  A Chinese
court historian named Sima Qian, who lived around 115 BCE, wrote a
biography of Lao Zi (literally “old master”, unless Lao is a family name
– in which case “master Lao”) that presents three different possible
traditions, although the accuracy of any of them is doubtful.  The first
says that Lao Zi was a contemporary of Confucius (500 BCE).  His family
name was Li (“plum”), his given name was Er (“ear”), and he was
posthumously called Dan (“long ear”). He was an official in the imperial
archives, but when the Zhou dynasty began to decline, he decided to
leave China.  When he reached the northwest border of China, the border
guard asked him to write down his teachings, which resulted in a
document of about 5000 characters in two sections.  Later in the same
document, Sima Qian also speculates that Lao Zi may or may not have been
Lao Dan (“old long ear”), an advisor to Duke Xian (370 BCE).  Finally,
Sima Qian says that a man named Lao Laizi (“old returning master”)
authored a Daoist book that had 15 parts, was born in the same province
as Lao Zi, and also was a contemporary of Confucius.  These three
accounts are further complicated by reported meetings between Confucius
and someone called Lao Dan in various Confucian texts.

 

References to the DDJ by other ancient Chinese writers indicate that at
least some parts of the DDJ were in existence by 300 BCE, and it was
being referred to extensively by 250 BCE.  One linguistic analysis of
the rhyme schemes indicates that it may have originated as early as 450
BCE, and if the DDJ contains the written version of earlier oral
traditions, these rhymes may reflect its oldest origins (because rhymes
are easier to memorize).  Other references and linguistic analyses place
its beginnings around perhaps 375-325 BCE, and the earliest known
written portions of it (described in the next section) date to about 300
BCE. 

 

So, some parts of the DDJ seem to have first appeared in written form
between roughly 350-300 BCE, although its roots could be much older.  It
certainly existed in some version of its finished form (roughly 5000
characters in 81 chapters) by 200 BCE. 

 

There is also debate on whether the text represents the work of mostly
one author, or was added to by different authors over the course of
about a century, or was later compiled from different traditions by one
person. 

 

The most recent versions of the DDJ are separated into 81 chapters, and
two major parts.  The first part, consisting of chapters 1-37, primarily
discusses Dao, while chapters 38-81 primarily discuss De.  Ancient
authors referring to the DDJ also speak of versions that are divided
into 64, 68, or 72 chapters.

==============================================================

 

Different Versions of the DDJ

 

There are at least six different ancient sources of the text (all dates
are approximate) :

 

“Guodian” (GUO) – discovered in 1993 and written around 300 BCE or
slightly earlier, this version matches only about 31 chapters of the
later versions of the DDJ, and its chapters are ordered completely
differently than the later versions.  The Chinese symbols are so ancient
that scholars disagree on what modern symbols they should correspond to,
and there are occasional spots on the originals where the characters can
no longer be read. 

 

“Mawangdui” (MWD) – discovered in 1973, there are two slightly different
versions (“A” and “B”), obviously written by two different people,
dating to about 200 BCE and 175 BCE respectively.  While all 81 chapters
are present, both versions reverse the two major parts (“Dao” and “De”)
compared to later versions.  In addition, the order of a few of the
chapters within the parts is different, as is the order of some sections
within the chapters!  The Chinese symbols are also so ancient that
scholars disagree on what modern symbols they should correspond to, and
there are many spots where the characters cannot be read. 

 

“Fu Yi” (FY) – Fu Yi was a scholar who lived around 600 CE and claimed
that the version he presents and discusses was found in a grave that
from his description could possibly be dated to around 200 BCE.

 

“Wang Bi” (WB) – written around 240 CE, this is the “standard” version
that most translators use, although there are several slightly different
variations of it.

 

“He Shang Gong” (HSG) – a legendary and possibly mythical person who may
have lived around 170 BCE, but the work which presents and discusses the
version of the DDJ associated with him is not mentioned by others until
300 CE.  Many scholars think this version was probably written closer to
300 CE and attributed to He Shang Gong to give it authority.  There are
also many slightly different variations of this text available.

 

In comparing the six sources, it is easy to see the changes in
philosophy of the early Daoists over the centuries.  In general, the
three earliest versions (GUO, MWD/A, MWD/B) more-or-less agree with each
other, the three later versions (FY, WB, HSG) more-or-less agree with
each other (despite the tentative dating of FY to 200 BCE), the two
groups are often slightly different from each other, and occasionally
very different.  However, FY does sometimes agree with the three earlier
versions.  Only the later versions contain the vast majority of
criticisms of Confucianism, although even GUO has a few.

 

WB, HSG, and FY were chosen as sources for this translation mainly
because their earliest manuscripts are complete, and the Chinese
characters are “modern” enough that there is less doubt as to their
meaning.  But there are occasional differences between them, so a 2/3
majority vote was used to determine which symbol to use.  This would
result in a document which is essentially the same as WB, since WB and
HSG are almost always the same.  However, in comparing all six sources
(or fewer if the chapter is not in GUO, or the earlier symbols cannot be
read), it becomes obvious that sometimes significant changes were made
only in the most recent sources.  Thus a symbol was changed to the one
used by the older sources if the majority of all available sources use
the different symbol, and it adds to the understanding of the sentence. 
In the case of a tie, the more recent symbol was used.  These rules were
used for adding or deleting symbols as well.

==============================================================

The Translation Process

 

There are many reasons why translations differ, besides the problems
inherent in translating from a language where : each symbol represents a
word that has multiple (sometimes very different) meanings; tenses,
articles, and plurals are not indicated; and one symbol can represent
either a noun or adjective, another a verb or adverb, another all four!

 

1.  What source is used : for WB and HSG, which version of what source;
    in the oldest sources, what modern symbols to use
2.  Accurately knowing all the possible English meanings for each symbol
    (and sometimes pairs of symbols), including changes in meaning over
    the millennia, and understanding ancient idioms
3.  Having to pick just one meaning for each symbol
4.  Organizing each sentence into something that makes sense, which is
    helped by understanding something of ancient Chinese grammar

 

The cultural background, knowledge, biases, beliefs, and agenda of the
translator affect every step but the first.  “Agenda” refers to how the
translator approaches the content of the DDJ : as a work of mysticism
vs. philosophy vs. military strategy vs. advice to emperors, etc.

 

The goals for this translation were :

-   Include an English word or phrase for every Chinese symbol in the
    sentence
-   Use exact translations of the Chinese symbols wherever possible
-   Minimal interpretation of individual symbols, only where needed for
    clarity
-   Use the same English word(s) for the same symbol(s) when appropriate
-   As few added English words as possible to make it a correct English
    sentence
-   No interpretation of the final translated sentence

 

Individual symbols are interpreted only when they either don’t make as
much sense literally, or the resulting sentence would be awkward in
English.  In some cases, if a symbol means two English words that both
seem to fit equally well, they are combined into one phrase, such as
“heart/mind” for 心 (see the next section), or 玄 which can mean
“mystery”, “profound”, “deep”, or “dark”, and is consistently translated
as “deep and mysterious” or “deep mystery”, depending on the context.

 

The above goals hopefully help minimize, but cannot eliminate,
translator bias.  The problem is that each Chinese symbol still has
several meanings, and the translator must pick just one for each symbol
(step 3) to create an English sentence that makes sense (step 4).  It is
impossible to avoid translator bias here because the translator must
choose what makes sense or feels right to them, in both word meanings
and overall grammar.

 

For example, there is a line in chapter 58 :  禍 兮 福 之 所 倚 where 兮
can mean “good fortune” or “happiness” and 禍 can mean “misfortune” or
“disaster”, but by reflection with 兮 could also be interpreted as
“unhappiness”.  倚 can mean “lean on”, “rely on”, or “depend on”, so all
of these are valid translations :

Misfortune is that which good fortune leans on.

Misfortune is that which good fortune relies on.

Misfortune is that which good fortune depends on.

Unhappiness is that which happiness leans on.

Unhappiness is that which happiness relies on.

Unhappiness is that which happiness depends on.

 

Beyond the differences between using “fortune” (less personal : what
happens to you) versus “happiness” (more personal : how you feel), there
are also subtle differences : saying that one “relies” on the other is
different than saying that they mutually support each other (as possibly
indicated by the sentence following this one, not shown here).   

 

Unlike the previous example, where the different translations for each
symbol are more-or-less related, sometimes the choice the translator
makes can affect the overall meaning or even the emotional impact of the
sentence.  In chapter 20, there is a line : 我 獨 若 遺 in which the
last symbol can be variously translated into :

I alone seem lost.                   

I alone seem to have lost everything.

I alone seem to have been left behind.          

I alone seem to be forgotten.

Each of which says a completely different thing.

 

And in chapter 46, there is a line : 罪 莫 大 於 可 欲 where the first
symbol can mean any of : “sin”, “crime”, “vice”, or “fault”, so
(ignoring options for the other symbols), all of these are valid :

There is no sin greater than the capacity for desire.

There is no crime greater than the capacity for desire.

There is no vice greater than the capacity for desire.

There is no fault greater than the capacity for desire.

“Sin” of course has very negative religious connotations in the West,
while “crime” and “vice” also have stronger negative associations than
“fault”. 

 

But there are other, even more significant ways in which the
translator’s choices affect the result.  Because of the many (sometimes
unrelated) possible meanings of each Chinese symbol, it is possible to
come up with multiple translations of the exact same sentence that are
completely different in meaning!  For example, in chapter 41, there is a
line : 大 方 無 隅 where 方 can mean both “region” and “square”, while
隅 can be “border” or “corner”, so both of these are valid translations
:

The greatest region is without borders.

The greatest square is without corners.

 

And in chapter 45 : 大 巧 若 拙 where 巧 can be “skillful” or “clever”,
and 拙 can mean “stupid” or “clumsy”, both of these are equally likely :

Great skillfulness seems clumsy.

Great cleverness seems stupid.

 

Finally, even when there is no ambiguity about the meaning of the
individual symbols, it sometimes hard to determine what overall meaning
was intended.  From chapter 35, there is a line : 道 之 出 言 淡 兮 in
which the first four symbols literally mean “words of Dao”, but does
this mean “talking about Dao” or “the words that come out of Dao”?  It
can be argued both ways due to subtleties in the meanings of the
symbols, but there is a tremendous difference in meaning between the two
translations.

 

In addition, there are a few symbols whose modern English meanings just
don’t make sense within the context of the sentence, probably due either
to transcription errors or changes in meaning over the millennia.  The
English words used for these symbols are usually selected according to
context.

 

==============================================================

 

Common Terms

 

Because the translation itself is meant to involve minimal
interpretation and explanation, some of the words and phrases that are
used repeatedly need to be discussed beforehand for clarity.  Keep in
mind that volumes have been written about some of these concepts – these
are just brief summaries for the reader new to Daoism.

 

道 Dao : most often translated as the “way”; according to various
passages in the DDJ, Dao appears to be the way of nature (or the
universe), the process of being in harmony with that way, the source
that creates and nourishes all things, and absolute ultimate reality
itself (and according to the opening lines of the first chapter, this
description is completely inadequate); it is left untranslated so that
readers may “fill in the blank” for themselves as they read; “the Dao”
is used as little as possible because in English that implies that Dao
is more of a thing than a process; Dao is sometimes referred to as “it”
to avoid awkward grammar (or if it was written that way in the original
Chinese), but do not think of Dao as a noun (just for fun sometime, try
reading “Dao” as “Daoing”…); one exception is when “Dao of” is used (for
example, “the Dao of heaven”) – this seems to be literally referring to
the way heaven does things, so it is translated as “the Way of heaven”,
but “Way” is capitalized to remind the reader that this is also Dao;
similarly, “this Dao” seems to be referring more to “this way (of
following Dao), and is translated “this Way”

 

德 De : most often translated as “virtue”, “integrity”, or “(inner)
power”, De is described in chapter 49 as “goodness” or “virtue” and
“honesty” or “trust”; De might be infused into things when they are
created by/from Dao, or something that develops when Dao is fully
expressed through a person; De seems to be both the quality of being
virtuous and the power that comes from being virtuous, so it might best
be thought of as “the power of one’s virtue” or “the power from one’s
integrity”, but it is also left untranslated so that readers may “fill
in the blank” for themselves as they read

 

天 “heaven” : a complex concept, this symbol seems to have connotations
of the sky, nature (including people and societies), that which controls
our destinies, as well as possibly that of a celestial god-like spirit
(and/or perhaps ancestral spirits)

 

天 地 “heaven and earth” : everything, the universe, all that is

 

天 下 “the world” : literally “heaven under”, it is perhaps better
thought of as “all things under heaven”; it is left as “the world”
because the English grammar sometimes gets awkward using the more
accurate phrase; some translate it as “the empire”, which gives the
entire document a much more imperialistic and militaristic slant

 

萬 物 “ten thousand creatures” : “ten thousand” as used here does not
refer to a specific number, but means “innumerable” or “myriad”;
together the symbols are perhaps better thought of as “all creatures and
things”

 

聖 人 “sage” : literally “holy man”; in the DDJ, a sage is anyone who
fully embodies and expresses Dao and De; as the ruling class would have
been one of the few literate groups in ancient Chinese culture reading
the DDJ, it seems possible that references to the way the sage does
things could have also been a subtle way of saying “this is what a wise
ruler would do” (especially in chapters like 5, 57, and 66, where the
sage seems to be the ruler)

 

常 “ever-constant” : while this is often translated as “eternal”, it
probably had more of a sense of “constant” or “permanent” in ancient
China; unfortunately “constant” doesn’t imply the enduring nature of
“permanent”, nor does “permanent” imply the unchanging quality of
“constant”, so “ever-constant” is used here

 

心 “heart/mind” : usually translated as either “heart” or “mind” (the
symbol means both), “heart/mind” seems to be the best translation

 

自 然 “naturally so” : this has the connotation of something that
happens spontaneously, without being forced (“of itself”, “of its own
accord”, “on its own”); Dao is “naturally so”, and although the DDJ does
not say so explicitly, presumably the sage acts “naturally so” as well

 

樸 “uncarved block” (of wood) : just as a block of wood can be carved
into virtually anything, in the DDJ the “uncarved block” represents the
limitless undefined potential of our original nature

 

無 為 “non-action” : not passivity or lack of action, but spontaneous
action taken at the proper time according to the situation

 

無 事 “non-interference” : to change the natural order of things as
little as possible in achieving your goals

 

無 知 “without-knowledge” : not an absence of knowledge, but a kind of
understanding that does not resort to pre-conceived ideas or rules

無 名 “without-name” : a reminder that things, concepts, and experiences
are far more than the names we give them and ultimately cannot be
described with words (in contrast to the Confucians, whose goal was to
find the “correct name” for everything)

 

無 欲 “without-desire” : not a total lack of desire, but desires that do
not control us or our happiness; a sort of spontaneous, unattached
desire

 

無 or 無 有 “non-being” : the nameless absolute that is the source of
all existence (“being”)

 

爭 “strive” : to struggle or make vigorous effort to achieve something,
perhaps competing against others to get it; the opposite of non-action

 

陰 “yin” : the feminine principle; receptive, yielding, dark, cool, soft

 

陽 “yang” : the masculine principle; aggressive, active, light, warm,
hard

 

氣 “qi” (ch’i, chi) : vitality, life energy, life force, vital energy

 

善 “virtue” : the traditional sense of moral virtue and  goodness

 

靜 “stillness” : a mental/emotional stillness of the heart/mind

 

谷 “valley” : the image of the valley is often used in the DDJ; a valley
represents receptiveness (because it accepts all things that come into
it), openness, and emptiness, and so is feminine in nature

 

身 “self” : often translated as “body” by others (it can mean either),
it is my personal bias that this symbol seems to consistently refer to
the sense-of-self, personality, or ego

 

復 or 歸 or 復 歸 or 反 “returning” : the DDJ uses four different
symbols to refer to the concept of returning, and it is used many times;
beyond the everyday meaning, in the DDJ creatures and people often
return to their source, true nature, or original state of pure and
unformed potential; sometimes they just “return”, and from where or to
where is not specified

 

明 “insight” : an intuitive, without-knowledge, understanding of what
is; this is another personal bias – while the literal translations
include “wise”, “clear”, “understanding”, “perceptive”, and “sight”, it
seems that this symbol can be consistently interpreted as “insight”
(which is in agreement with the literal translations); in addition, it
is variously translated by other modern translators as “enlightenment”
and even “insight”

 

事 “duties” : one’s personal and business affairs, responsibilities,
etc.

 

吾 “I” : on the rare occasions this is used, think of this as someone
who is a sage-like Daoist rather than merely “the author”

 

百 姓 “100 families” : in ancient times this phrase referred to the
entire ruling class

 

士 “scholar” : around the time of the DDJ, this referred to the elite
“intellectual” class of  Chinese society, the teachers and philosophers
(Confucius would have been considered a scholar)

 

君 “ruler”, 王 “king”, etc. : there are many symbols and euphemisms for
various members of the nobility (“nobles”, “superiors”, “master of the
people”, “son of heaven”, “master of 10,000 chariots”, etc.)

 

貴 “high rank” : any position of power or admiration

 

While the DDJ is over 2000 years old, its wisdom is still applicable
today, but don’t be fooled by the ancient wording!   “King” could today
apply to anyone who runs things, manages others, or leads any kind of
group (from the nation’s leader to a corporation CEO to…your boss), and
“high rank” could apply to government officials, billionaires, or even
movie stars.

 

 

There are also many Confucian terms used in the DDJ :

 

仁 “kindness” : being benevolent, kindhearted, humane
義 “righteousness” (translated as “morality” to avoid religious
associations) : having a sense of justice, doing

     the right thing, being morally upright

禮 “propriety” : ritual courtesy and formality; proper etiquette
智 “wise”, “wisdom” : as it says
信 “truth”, “trust”, “honest” : as it says
忠 “loyalty” : as it says
勇 “courage”, “brave” : as it says

廉 “honorable” : having a sense of honor or integrity; incorruptibility

孝 “filial piety” (translated as “devoted children”) : respect your
elders and parents, duty to your parents, care

     for the elderly
慈 “compassion” : benevolence, mercy; as specifically applied to
parents’ attitude towards their children, this is

     translated as “loving parents”

君 子 “noble man” : literally “son of the ruler”, this can mean
“nobleman” (one who belongs to the nobility),

     but is also a Confucian term that means one who is noble or moral
in character and embodies the above

     qualities; sometimes translated by others as “gentleman” or
“superior man”

 

 

Many symbols in the DDJ are used to provide emphasis (similar to an
exclamation point in English), and can either come at the end of a
sentence or can be used to emphasize a word or phrase in the middle of a
sentence.  Many translators ignore these latter symbols entirely, while
others preface the emphasized word with “so…”, “such…”, “very…”, “oh,…”,
etc.  Here, an exclamation point is used immediately after the word, but
then the sentence continues on.  One symbol in particular implies that
what precedes it is not only true but has always been true, which is
translated as “indeed!”

Appendix – Different Layers of the Dao De Jing

 

While translating the DDJ, I discovered John Emerson’s articles on the
possibility of various “layers” within it, based on the presence or
absence of certain symbols and “themes” in each chapter.  While he was
not the first to suggest the presence of multiple layers, of particular
interest to me was his comment : “Many of the objections to my method
seemed to be objections to the kinds of rough, empirical,
non-algorithmic methods best used to disentangle historically confused
material.”  Having a background in something called pattern recognition,
I decided to find out whether or not each chapter could be classified as
belonging to these layers based on this purely analytical method.

 

Emerson tentatively identified Early, Middle, Late, Added (very small)
and Post-Guodian layers.  By definition, the Post-Guodian layer contains
at least chapters 67-81, none of which appear in the Guodian source. 
Building on Emerson’s work, extensive analysis using pattern recognition
methods based on the relative frequencies of the symbols in each chapter
indicates that the most self-consistent results are obtained when the
DDJ is separated into three layers of chapters :

Early : 1 4 5 6 7 9 10 13 14 15 16 20 21 23 24 25 28 30 31 32 34 35 37
39 41 44 51 52 55 56

Late : 3 8 12 17 18 19 22 27 29 38 45 46 47 48 49 53 54 57 58 59 60 61
62 63 64 65 66

Post-Guodian : 11 26 33 36 40 42 43 50 67-81

Mixed : 2        
                                                           

 

Excluding the chapters he identified as Middle (which ended up being
assigned very evenly across the other three layers), none of these
completely disagree with Emerson’s assignments (except for 52, which is
the only entire chapter he considered to be Added), although he assigns
some sections of some chapters to other layers.  While a significant
majority (85%) of the chapters were strongly identified as belonging to
their layer (the underlined chapters above), the pattern recognition
process did indicate that a few (most notably chapters 24, 45, 46, 59,
and 62, and to a lesser extent 8, 22, 30, 39, 44, and 49) may have
elements of more than one layer present within them.

 

Note that while Emerson’s names (Early, Late, Post-Guodian) are kept for
convenience, they don’t necessarily have to indicate separation in time
– they could perhaps represent different oral traditions, or sayings
that originally developed in different regions of China, which combined
to form the Dao De Jing we know today.  Also note that the Guodian
document (~300 BCE) consists of chapters from both Early and Late in
roughly equal numbers, so this “layering” actually happened very early.

 

Although chapter 40 was identified as being strongly Post-Guodian, it is
present in the Guodian manuscript, but that is not considered a major
problem. For example, if perhaps the post-Guodian “style” was already
being developed at the time the Guodian document was created, then the
presence of chapter 40 in the document could mean that it had already
been written in this style, perhaps shortly before the Guodian document
was created, whereas chapters 68-81 had yet to be written (or the
Guodian compiler was not aware of their existence).  There are probably
many other scenarios that could explain such a result.

 

Chapter 2 was variously classified as belonging to all three layers, but
the symbol distributions (below) simultaneously indicated that it cannot
belong to any of them!  If any chapter is truly a mixture of layers, it
is this one (which Emerson agrees with), so it is not assigned to any.

 

With the chapters separated as given above, it is possible to identify
which symbols are used more often in one layer than another, as shown in
the table below.  Each line represents one symbol, and shows its various
English meanings (as used in this translation).  “Weak” symbols show up
three to six times more often in the indicated layer than the other two,
while “Strong” symbols show up more than six times more often.  Within
these sections, symbols are ordered from the least unbalanced to most
unbalanced distributions between the layers.  “Unique” symbols show up
only in that layer, and not even once in the others.  In these sections,
words are listed from fewest appearances to most appearances.  Weak and
Strong symbols must show up in at least five chapters to be included,
while Unique symbols must be in at least three chapters.  Phrases (two
or more symbols) are shown in italics.  Some punctuation symbols are
included as they tend to show differences in grammatical conventions
between the layers.  Where two symbols are consistently translated into
the same punctuation, (#1) and (#2) are used to distinguish between
them.

The symbol for “die, death” that is strongly Post-Guodian is in only one
non-Post-Guodian chapter (6, where the “spirit of the valley does not
die”).  All of the other 17 times (!) it is used is in Post-Guodian
chapters, so if it wasn’t for the one use in chapter 6, this symbol
would be strongly unique to the Post-Guodian chapters.

 

Symbols that show up much more often in two layers but rarely in the
other one are presented in the table on the following page, in the same
format as the previous one.  Symbols in the “Never” sections appear
about equally often in the other two layers, but not once in the
indicated layer.

 

“Dao” is almost three times more likely to appear in Early and Late than
Post-Guodian (and there almost always as “Dao of”), but not quite enough
to make it into the following table (under “Rarely in Post-Guodian”).

Besides the symbol distributions, it is interesting to note that of the
six chapters in which the majority of the sources are anti-Confucian,
all but chapter 33 are Late (and it is Post-Guodian) – thus none of the
Early chapters are anti-Confucian.   Also, the anti-military chapters
(30, 31) are Early, while the chapters offering military advice (68, 69)
are Post-Guodian.   Finally, “living for the substance” is a good thing
in chapter 38 (Late), but a bad thing in chapters 50 and 75 (both
Post-Guodian).

 

Early chapters are more concerned with heaven and earth, images of the
feminine and the child, the concepts of “without-name” and “no danger”,
and are the only chapters that try to describe Dao (1, 4, 14, 21, 25,
32, 34, 35), while they have little to do with the sage (only twice
using “thus the sage” in 30 chapters), governing the nation, easy vs.
difficult, and never mention the concept of “not striving”.

 

Late chapters have more Confucian terms, advice on how to rule, and talk
about non-interference, but at the same time are the only ones that talk
about possessing or “taking hold of” the world or the nation. 

 

Post-Guodian chapters also offer some advice on how to rule, tend to
deal with hard/soft/weak/strong, are the only chapters that offer
military advice, and talk a lot about death, but rarely mention Dao or
De, and never mention the feminine, the child, emptiness, or the
uncarved block.

 

The rest of the appendix collects all the chapters of each layer
together, so the reader can see their common themes.  The final section
is called “What Would the Sage Do?”, and collects every reference to the
Sage from the entire document.

EARLY

 

One

The Dao that can be spoken of is not the ever-constant

      Dao.

The name that can be named is not the ever-constant

      name.

That which is without-name is the beginning of heaven

      and earth.

That which possesses a name is the mother of the ten

      thousand creatures.

 

Therefore : always without-desire, thus you observe its

      subtle mystery.

Always possessing desires, thus you observe its external

      appearances.

These two, they arise from the same source but have

      different names;

This sameness is called their deep mystery.

 

Deep mysteries, and again deep mysteries –

The gateway of many subtle mysteries.

 

 

Four

Dao is like a cup or bowl, yet use it and there exists no

      need to fill it.

Profound and deep!, it appears to be the ancestor of the

      ten thousand creatures.

 

It blunts their sharpness,

Loosens their tangles,

Softens their brightness,

Makes them the same as the dust of the world.

 

Deep and profound!, it seems to barely exist.

I do not know whose child it is –

Its image came before that of god.

 

 

Five

Heaven and earth are not kind –

Thus the ten thousand creatures become as straw dogs to

      them.

The sage is not kind –

Thus the 100 families become as straw dogs to him.

 

The space between heaven and earth,

How is it just like a bellows or flute?

It is empty, yet does not run out.

The more it moves, and the more it produces.

 

Too much talking is exceptionally exhausting,

Which is not as good as maintaining what is within.

 

 

Six

The spirit of the valley does not die –

It is called the deep and mysterious feminine.

 

The gateway of this deep and mysterious feminine – 

It is called the source of heaven and earth.

 

Unbroken, it seems to exist.

Using it takes no effort.

 

 

Seven

Heaven is eternal, earth is enduring.                           

The reason that heaven and earth can be eternal and

      enduring

Is because they do not live for themselves.

Therefore they can live forever.         

 

Thus the sage :

Puts his self behind others, yet finds his self before them.

Considers his self extraneous, yet his self survives.

 

Is this not because he has no self-interests?

Therefore he can achieve his self-interests.

 

 

Nine

Holding and filling it

Are not as good as your stopping short.

 

Hammering and sharpening it

Can not be forever maintained.

 

When gold and jade fill a room,

There is no one who can protect it.

 

To have wealth and high rank, but with arrogance –

Then naturally their loss is your own fault.

 

When the task is successful, the self should let go of it.         

This is the Way of heaven.

 

 

Ten

Carrying and managing a body while embracing the One,

Are you able to not separate them?

Concentrating your Qi to become soft,           

Are you able to be like a newborn infant?

Cleansing and clearing your deep and mysterious

      perception,

Are you able to be without blemish?

Loving the citizens and governing the nation,

Are you able to use non-action?

Opening and closing the gateway of heaven,

Are you able to serve as the feminine?

Attaining clear insight in all
directions,                                   

Are you able to not use your knowledge?

 

Creating them and raising them,

Creating but not possessing,

Acting but not concerned with the results,

Leading yet not governing –

This is called deep and mysterious De.

 

 

Thirteen

Favor and disgrace seem alarming.

High rank brings great suffering if you have a self.

 

What is meant by “favor and disgrace seem alarming”?

Favor makes you the inferior, so gaining it seems

      alarming.

Losing it also seems alarming.

This is what is meant by “favor and disgrace seem

      alarming”.

 

What is meant by “high rank brings great suffering if

      you have a self”?

I am the reason that I have great suffering, I who act like

      I have a self.

When I am without a self, how could I have suffering?

 

Therefore : he who is high ranking and uses his self to

      serve the world –

It seems he can thus be entrusted with the world!

He who is loving and uses his self to serve the world –

It seems he can thus be entrusted with the world!

 

 

Fourteen

Look, it is not seen; its name is called elusive.

Listen, it is not heard; its name is called tenuous.

Grasp, it is not gotten; its name is called subtle and

      obscure.

These three things can not be investigated any further –

Therefore they blend and become one.

 

This one thing :

Its highest point is not bright;

Its lowest point is not dark.

Continuous and unending!, it can not be named;

It returns to non-existence.

It is called the form of that which is without-form;

The image of non-existence.

It is called confusing and indistinct.

Meet it and you do not see its beginning;

Follow it and you do not see its end.

 

Hold fast to the Way of the ancients

In order to master the present moment.

The ability to know the ancient beginning –

This is called the main principle of Dao.

 

 

Fifteen

The virtue of the ancients made they who were scholars

      subtle, mysterious, obscure, deep, and penetrating.

Their mysterious depths can not be understood.

 

Now : only because they can not be understood,

Therefore we try to emulate their appearance :

Hesitant!, as if crossing a winter stream.

Wary!, as if afraid of their neighbors all around.        

Respectful!, they are like a visiting guest.

Yielding!, like ice that is about to to break off.

Honest and genuine!, they are like the uncarved block.

Wide and open!, they are like a valley.

Unclear!, they are like muddy water.

 

Who can take muddy water and use stillness to slowly and

      gently make it pure and clear?

Who can take what is tranquil and use continual movement

      to slowly and gently bring it to life?

 

He who maintains this Way does not desire to be full.

Now : only because he is not full,

Thus he can be hidden and unfinished.

 

 

Sixteen

Attain the utmost emptiness.

Maintain a profound stillness.

 

The ten thousand creatures arise in unison,

And thus I observe their return.

Now : all the myriad creatures return to their source.

Returning to the source speaks of stillness.

Stillness is called returning to the natural order.

Returning to the natural order speaks of the

      ever-constant.

 

Knowing the ever-constant speaks of insight.

Not knowing the ever-constant is foolish and creates

      misfortune.

 

Knowing the ever-constant leads to tolerance.

Being tolerant leads to being just and unbiased.

Being just and unbiased leads to being kingly.

Being kingly leads to heaven.

Heaven leads to Dao.

Dao leads to what endures.

 

When the self disappears, there can be no danger.

 

 

Twenty

Renounce learning and be without worry.

 

“Yes” together with “yeah” –

What is their mutual distance or nearness?

Beautiful together with ugliness –

What is their mutual distance or similarity?

 

That which people fear, they are not able to not fear.

How ridiculous! They are not yet centered!

 

Everyone is very festive,

As if enjoying the Tai Lao sacrifice,

As if climbing terraces in the spring.

I alone am unmoved! –

Like one who has not yet given any sign,

Like a newborn infant who does not yet act like a baby.

Very tired and worn out!, as if without a place to return

      to.

 

Everyone all has more than they need;

I alone seem to have lost everything.

I have the heart/mind of a foolish person, indeed!!

I am very mixed up and confused!

 

Common people are very clear and bright;

I alone seem confused.

Common people are very observant and alert;

I alone am very gloomy and depressed.

Tranquil!, they are like the ocean;

I drift on the wind!, as if without a place to rest.

Everyone all has a purpose;
I alone am stupid and stubborn, and appear mean and

      shallow.

I alone am different compared to other people,

And value the food of the mother.

 

 

Twenty one

The greatest De is possible only when Dao is followed.

 

The action of Dao on creatures is just indistinct, just

      confusing.

Confusing! and indistinct!, within it exists image.

Indistinct! and confusing!, within it exists things.

Obscure! and dark!, within it exists essence.

Its essence is extremely real and true.

Within it exists truth.

 

From the present reaching to antiquity,

Its name has not departed –

Thus I observe the father of the multitudes.

How do I thus know the father of the multitudes is like

      this?

By means of this.

 

 

Twenty three

Minimal words are naturally so.

Therefore : strong winds do not last the entire morning,         

Sudden rains do not last the entire day.

 

Who makes these things?  Heaven and earth.

Even heaven and earth can not maintain them forever,

And so how much less can people?

 

Therefore : of those who engage in Dao –

He who Daos is one with Dao.

He who Des is one with De.   

He who loses is one with the loss.

 

For he who is one with Dao,      

Dao is also pleased to have him.         

For he who is one with De,     

De is also pleased to have him.           

For he who is one with loss,   

Loss is also pleased to have him.

 

If you do not trust enough, then you will not have

      anyone’s trust.

 

 

Twenty four

He who stands on tiptoe does not really stand.

He who stands astride can not travel.

He who displays himself does not have insight.

He who considers himself correct does not distinguish

      himself.    

He who boasts about himself is without merit.

He who brags about himself does not endure.

 

He who lives in Dao –
Calls these leftover food and unnecessary behavior.
Creatures detest them, no matter what.
Therefore : he who possesses Dao does not live by them.

 

 

Twenty five

Something existed unformed yet complete,
Before heaven and earth were created.
Silent!  Empty!

Standing alone, not changing.
It circulates everywhere, and causes no danger.

It can be considered the mother of the world.

 

I do not know its name;

Its symbol is called Dao.
If I tried to make its name, I would call it great.
Being great speaks of departing.
Departing speaks of being remote.

Being remote speaks of returning.

 

Dao is great,

Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
The king is also great.
Within the realm exist four that are great,
And the king resides as one of them!

 

People follow the earth.
The earth follows heaven.
Heaven follows Dao.
Dao follows what is naturally so.

 

 

Twenty eight

Know your maleness, but maintain your femaleness.

Serve as a stream to the world.   

Serving as a stream to the world,

The ever-constant De will not depart,

Returning you to the state of the newborn infant.

 

Know your brightness, but maintain your darkness.

Serve as an example to the world.

Serving as an example to the world,

The ever-constant De will not falter,

Returning you to the state of the limitless.

 

Know your honor, but maintain your disgrace.

Serve as a valley to the world.

Serving as a valley to the world,

The ever-constant De will then be sufficient,

Returning you to the state of the uncarved block.

 

When the uncarved block is broken up, then it becomes

      tools.

When the sage uses it, then he becomes the senior

      government official.

Therefore : the greatest cutting does not divide.

 

 

Thirty

He who uses Dao to assist the master of the people

Does not use weapons or strength on the world,

For his troubles would likely return –

In the dwelling places of armies, thorns and brambles are

      produced,

And so what is left behind a great army must have a bad

      year.

 

He who has virtue gets results and stops.

He does not dare to take by using strength.

He gets results, but never brags.          

Gets results, but never boasts.

Gets results, but is not arrogant.

Gets results, but only when he has no choice.

Gets results, but never uses strength.

 

When creatures are robust but old,

This is called “not Dao”.

That which is “not Dao” has an early finish.

 

 

Thirty one

Now : fine weapons, they are not tools of good fortune.

Creatures detest them, no matter what.

Therefore : he who possesses Dao does not live by them.

When a noble man is in his dwelling, then he honors the

      left.

When he commands troops, then he honors the right.

 

Weapons, they are not tools of good fortune.

They are not the tools of a noble man.

When he has no choice but to use them,

To be calm and indifferent is superior –

Never pleased, indeed!

And he who is pleased enjoys killing people.

 

Now : he who enjoys killing people

Can not get what he desires from the world!

 

Therefore : in fortunate affairs honor the left,

In unfortunate affairs honor the right.

Thus the assistant general of the army resides on the left,

The supreme general of the army resides on the right.

 

Thus we say they are dwelling at a funeral :

When many people are killed,

Then mourn and weep with grief for them.

Victory in war thus means they will dwell at a funeral.

 

 

Thirty two

Dao is ever-constantly without-name.

 

Even though the concept of the uncarved block seems

      insignificant,

No one in the world can conquer it.

If nobles and kings could maintain it,

The ten thousand creatures would naturally obey.

Heaven and earth would join with each other,

Thus dropping a sweet dew.

There are no citizens who would make this happen,

Yet it would be naturally fair and impartial.

 

And so, begin to divide and you have names.

Once names exist,

Men should also be ready to know when to stop.

Knowing when to stop is the reason that there is no

      danger.

 

An analogy for the action of Dao in the world :

It is similar to a stream in a valley that becomes part of a

      large river or ocean.

 

 

Thirty four

Great Dao is like a vast flood!

It is able to flow left and right.

 

The ten thousand creatures depend on it in order for life,

And are not rejected.

It accomplishes its tasks successfully,

Yet does not possess a name.

It clothes and supports the ten thousand creatures,

But does not act as their master.

 

Therefore : since it is ever-constantly without-desire,

It can then be named insignificant.

 

Since the ten thousand creatures return to it

But it does not act as their master,

It can then be named great.

 

Thus the sage can achieve greatness   

Because he does not act great.

Therefore he can achieve greatness.

 

 

Thirty five

Holding fast to the great image,

The entire world comes towards you.

Comes towards you, and meeting with no harm,

There is the greatest peace and calm.

 

Music together with good food make passing guests stay,

But Dao’s words are bland!

They are without flavor.

 

Look for it, there is not enough to see.

Listen for it, there is not enough to hear.

Use it, there is not enough to exhaust.

 

 

Thirty seven

Dao ever-constantly resides in non-action,

Yet nothing is left undone.

 

If nobles and kings could maintain it,

The ten thousand creatures would naturally transform.

Transform, and if desire arises,

I would restrain it by means of the nameless uncarved

      block.           

 

In the state of the nameless uncarved block,

Men also would be without-desire.

Not desiring, thus they would be still –

And the world would naturally settle.

 

 

Thirty nine

Of those who in ancient times attained oneness :

Heaven attained oneness, thus becoming pure and clear.

Earth attained oneness, thus becoming stable.

Spirit attained oneness, thus becoming potent.

The valley attained oneness, thus becoming full.

The ten thousand creatures attained oneness, thus

      becoming alive.

Nobles and kings attained oneness, thus serving the

      world faithfully.

They attained it.

 

If heaven could not use its purity and clarity,

I fear it would split apart.

If earth could not use its stability,

I fear it would erupt.

If spirit could not use its potency,

I fear it would cease to be.

If the valley could not use its fullness,

I fear it would be used up.

If the ten thousand creatures could not use their life,

I fear they would be destroyed.

If nobles and kings could not use their high rank and

      prominence,

I fear they would fall.

 

Therefore : humility thus serves as the source of high

      rank;

Low thus serves as the foundation of high.

Thus nobles and kings call themselves orphaned, lonely,

        and unlucky.

Does this not mean that humility thus serves as the

      source?

Does it not?

 

Therefore : to attain exceptional popularity is to be

      without popularity –

Do not desire to be scarce like jade,

But common like rock.

 

 

Forty one

The superior scholar hearing of Dao works hard and

      practices it.

The average scholar hearing of Dao seems to keep it,

      seems to lose it.

The inferior scholar hearing of Dao laughs greatly at it.

If he did not laugh, it would not be qualified to be Dao.

 

Therefore : in the established sayings that exist, it is

      said –

Insight into Dao seems like darkness.

Advancing in Dao seems like retreating.

Smooth Dao seems knotted.

Superior De seems like a valley.

The greatest purity seems like disgrace.

The most extensive De seems like it is not enough.

Established De seems aimless.

Real and true character seems inconsistent.

 

The greatest region is without borders.

The greatest vessel is last to be completed.

The greatest tone is a tenuous sound.

The greatest image is without-form.

Dao is hidden and without-name.

 

Now : only Dao is good at beginning and also good at

      completing.

 

 

Forty four

Fame and self : which do you love?

Self and property : which is greater?

Gain and loss : which is the affliction?

 

Extreme desire must lead to great expense.

Collecting too much must lead to substantial loss.

 

Knowing when you have enough, there can be no

      disgrace.

Knowing when to stop, there can be no danger.

Then you can forever endure.

 

 

Fifty one

Dao creates them,

De raises them,

Things shape them,

Circumstances complete them.

 

Thus among the ten thousand creatures,

There are none who do not respect Dao and honor De.

Respect of Dao,

Honor of De –

Now : there is no one who commands this,

Yet it is always naturally so.

 

Therefore : Dao creates them, De raises them.

Leads them, nourishes them,

Shelters them, heals  them,

Supports them, protects them.

 

Creating but not possessing,

Acting but not concerned with the results,

Leading yet not governing –

This is called deep and mysterious De.

 

 

Fifty two

The world had a beginning,

Which can be considered the mother of the world.

Once you have realized its mother,

You thus know her children.

Once you know her children,

Return to and maintain their mother.

 

When the self disappears, there can be no danger.     

 

Block your senses, close your gateway –

All your life you will not struggle.

Open your senses, be successful in your duties –

All your life you will not have relief.

 

Seeing the insignificant speaks of insight.

Maintaining softness speaks of strength.

Use your brightness to return to your insight.

Do not lose your self in misfortune.

This is called practicing the ever-constant.

 

 

Fifty five

He who embodies the substance of De

Can be compared to a newborn child :

Wasps, scorpions, snakes, and serpents do not sting him,

Fierce beasts do not seize him,

Birds of prey do not claw him.                                   

His bones are weak, his muscles are soft, yet his grasp is

      firm and strong.

He has not yet known the union of female and male, yet

      his penis rises.

He has the utmost essence, indeed!

He cries the entire day yet does not get hoarse.

He has the utmost harmony, indeed!

 

Knowing harmony speaks of the ever-constant.

Knowing the ever-constant speaks of insight.

Benefitting life speaks of good fortune.

Heart/mind making Qi speaks of strength.

 

When creatures are robust but old,

We call them “not Dao”.

That which is “not Dao” has an early finish.

 

 

Fifty six

He who knows does not speak;

He who speaks does not know.

 

Block your senses, close your gateway.

Blunt your sharpness,

Loosen your tangles,

Soften your brightness,

Be the same as the dust of the world.

This is called a deep and mysterious sameness.

 

Therefore : you can not gain it and be friendly,

Can not gain it and be unfriendly,

Can not gain it and benefit,

Can not gain it and cause harm,

Can not gain it and have high rank,

Can not gain it and be lowly.

 

Therefore you become valuable to the world.

LATE

 

Three

Not honoring those who are esteemable

Ensures that the citizens do not strive.

Not valuing rare goods

Ensures that the citizens do not act like thieves.

Not showing that which can be desired

Ensures that the citizens’ heart/minds do not become

      confused.

 

Thus the governing of the sage

Empties their heart/minds, fills their stomachs,

Weakens their ambitions, strengthens their bones.

 

By always ensuring that the citizens are

      without-knowledge and without-desire,

Those who make men wise will not dare to act.

 

Act with non-action, then all will be governed!

 

 

Eight

The highest virtue is like water –

Water’s virtue benefits the ten thousand creatures, yet it

      does not strive.

It dwells in places that everyone detests,

Therefore it is almost comparable to Dao!

 

In dwelling, the virtue is in the land.

In your heart/mind, the virtue is in being profound and

      deep.

In relations, the virtue is in being kind.

In speech, the virtue is in being truthful.

In governing, the virtue is in being honest and just.

In your duties, the virtue is in being competent.

In action, the virtue is in the timing.

 

Now : only because there is no striving,

Therefore there is no blame.

 

 

Twelve

The five colors can make people’s eyes blind.

The five tones can make people’s ears deaf.

The five flavors can make people’s mouths dull.

Excessive hunting and horse racing can make people’s

      heart/minds become wild.  

Rare goods can make people’s behavior corrupt.       

 

Thus the sage :

Acts on what is inside, he does not act on what he sees.

Therefore he leaves that and chooses this.

 

 

Seventeen

The existence of the best ruler is barely known to the

      people.

Next is one who they love and praise.

Next is one who they fear.

Next is one who they ridicule.

 

If the ruler does not trust enough, then he will not have

      anyone’s trust.

 

Thoughtful!, he values his words.

 

When tasks are accomplished and duties are successful,

The 100 families all say “we are naturally so”.

 

 

Eighteen

When the great Dao is abandoned,

There exists kindness and morality.

 

When intelligence and wisdom arise,

There exists a great deal of deception.

 

When the six relationships are not in harmony,

There exists devoted children and loving parents.

 

When the nation and the families are very confused,

There exists loyal officials.

 

 

Nineteen

Renounce sacredness, abandon wisdom,

And the citizens benefit 100-fold.

Renounce kindness, abandon morality,

And the citizens return to being devoted children and

      loving parents.

Renounce cleverness, abandon profit,

And thieves and bandits will not exist.

 

These three things thus make a civilized society, but are

      not enough.

 

Therefore : to ensure the citizens have a place to belong–

See the simplicity,

Embrace the concept of the uncarved block,

Less selfishness,

Fewer desires.

 

 

Twenty two

What is wrong then becomes whole and perfect.

What is bent then becomes straight.

What is hollow then becomes filled.

What is worn out then becomes new.

Have little, then gain.

Have too much, then become confused.

 

Thus the sage :

Embraces the One, thus serving as an example to the

      world –

He does not display himself, therefore he has insight.

Does not consider himself correct, therefore he

      distinguishes himself.

Does not boast about himself, therefore he possesses

      merit.

Does not brag about himself, therefore he endures.

 

Now : only because he does not strive,

Therefore no one in the world can strive against him.

 

That which the ancients say :

“He who is wrong then becomes whole and perfect” –

How can these be empty words?

Be truly whole and perfect, and return to it.

 

 

Twenty seven

A good traveler is without wagon track or footprint.

A good speaker is without flaw or disgrace.

A good accountant does not use counting tokens.

A good barrier is without bar or lock, yet can not be

      opened.

A good binding is without cord or restraint, yet can not

      be loosened.

 

Thus the sage :

Is always good at helping people,

Therefore he does not abandon people.          

Is always good at helping creatures,

Therefore he does not abandon creatures.

This is called following your insight.

 

Therefore : he who is a virtuous person is the teacher of

      he who is not a virtuous person.

He who is not a virtuous person is the resource of he

      who is a virtuous person.  

If the latter does not value his teacher,

Or the former does not love his resource,

Even if there is wisdom, there will be great confusion.

This is called the essential subtle mystery.

 

 

Twenty nine

Would you take hold of the world and control it?      

I see you have no choice.

 

Now : the world is a divine vessel,

You can not control it (indeed!).

He who acts, ruins it;

He who grasps, loses it.

 

Therefore : creatures are

Sometimes active, sometimes passive,

Sometimes breathe heavy, sometimes breathe easy,

Sometimes strong, sometimes weak,

Sometimes oppressed, sometimes overthrown.

 

Thus the sage :

Removes the extremes,

Removes the extravagant and wasteful,

Removes the arrogance.

 

 

Thirty eight

A man of highest De does not use his De, thus he

      possesses De.

A man of inferior De does not lose his De, thus he is

      without De.

 

A man of highest De uses non-action, and acts without

      motive.                                  

A man of inferior De coerces others, and has a motive to

      act.

A man of highest kindness coerces others, and acts

      without motive.       

A man of highest morality coerces others, and has a

      motive to act.

A man of highest propriety coerces others, and if there

      is no one who responds,

Then he rolls up his sleeves and keeps doing it.

 

Therefore : lose Dao, and later comes De.

Lose De, and later comes kindness.

Lose kindness, and later comes morality.

Lose morality, and later comes propriety.

Now : propriety is that which is merely the appearance

      of loyalty and honesty,

And the beginning of confusion.

 

He who is ahead in knowledge has the flower of Dao,

But the beginning of stupidity and foolishness.

 

Thus the greatest elders :

Live by Dao’s substance, and do not dwell on Dao’s

      appearance.

Live on Dao’s fruit, and do not dwell on Dao’s flower.         

Therefore they leave that and choose this.

 

 

Forty five

Great achievement seems incomplete,

But its usefulness is not impaired.

 

Great fullness is like a cup or bowl,

Its usefulness is not exhausted.

 

Great straightness seems bent.

Great skillfulness seems clumsy.

Great debaters seem slow of speech.

 

Restlessness conquers cold.

Stillness conquers heat.

 

Purity and clarity along with stillness makes the world

      proper and correct.

 

 

Forty six

When the world possesses Dao,

Riding horses are nonetheless used for manure.

When the world is without Dao,

War-horses are bred in the
countryside.                                             

 

There is no fault greater than the capacity for desire.

There is no misfortune greater than not knowing when

      you have enough.

There is no error greater than desire for gain.

 

Therefore : knowing the sufficiency of having enough,

      there is always enough!

 

 

Forty seven

You do not have to go out the door

In order to to know the world.

You do not have to look out the window        

In order to to know the Way of heaven.                     

 

The farther you go out,

You know even less.

 

Thus the sage :

Does not travel, yet knows.

Does not display himself, yet has a reputation.

Does not act, yet accomplishes.

 

 

Forty eight

The actions of those who learn daily increase.

The actions of those who Dao daily decrease.

Decreasing and again decreasing,

In order to arrive at non-action.

 

Use non-action, and nothing is left undone.

To take hold of the world, always use non-interference.

When you are compelled  to interfere,

Then you are not qualified to take hold of the world.

 

 

Forty nine

The sage does not have a constant heart/mind,

Thus the 100 families’ heart/minds become his

      heart/mind.

 

He who is virtuous, I am virtuous to him.

He who is not virtuous, I am also virtuous to him.

Because De is virtue.

 

He who is honest, I am honest with him.

He who is not honest, I am also honest with him.

Because De is honesty.

 

The sage lives in the world, gathering it all in.

And so he serves the world, merging with their

      heart/minds.

 

The 100 families all pay attention to their ears and eyes,

And the sage treats them all like his children.

 

 

Fifty three

If I correctly use the tiniest bit of knowledge that I

      possess

While travelling on the great Way,

It is only walking off the path that I need to fear.

The great Way is extremely even,

But the citizens are fond of side paths.

 

Although the royal court is very well-kept,

The fields are very overgrown with weeds,

The granaries are very empty.

While at the court they wear refined multicolored silks,

Carry sharp swords,

Stuff themselves with drink and food,

And have an excess of wealth and goods.

 

This is called robbery and extravagance,

Not Dao, indeed!!

 

 

Fifty four

That which is well established is not uprooted.

That which is well embraced is not abandoned.

Thus children and grandchildren offer sacrifices, and so

      sacrifices do not stop.

 

Cultivate it in the self – your De will then be true and

      real.

Cultivate it in the family – its De will then be more than

      enough.

Cultivate it in the village – its De will then last forever.

Cultivate it in the nation – its De will then be abundant.

Cultivate it in the world – its De will then be everywhere.

 

Therefore : use your self to contemplate the self.

Use your family to contemplate the family.

Use your village to contemplate the village.

Use your nation to contemplate the nation.

Use the world to contemplate the world.

 

How do I thus know the world is like this?

By means of this.

 

 

Fifty seven

Use honesty and justness when governing a nation.

Use strange and unusual tactics when commanding

      troops.

Use non-interference to take hold of the world.

How do I thus know it is like this?

By means of this :

 

The world has many prohibitions and taboos,

And the citizens become even poorer.

The citizens have many sharp tools,

And the nation and the families grow in confusion.

The people have too much knowledge and cleverness,

And strange things begin to increase.

Matters of law are increasingly proclaimed,

And more thieves and bandits exist.

 

Therefore : the sage says –

I use non-action, and the citizens naturally transform.

I cherish stillness, and the citizens naturally become

      honest and just.

I use non-interference, and the citizens naturally become

      wealthy.

I am without-desire, and the citizens naturally return to

      the state of the uncarved block.

 

 

Fifty eight

If their government is very restrained,

Its citizens will be very genuine and honest.

If their government is very observant and alert,

Its citizens will be very lacking and deficient.

 

Misfortune! is that which good fortune leans on.        

Good fortune! is that which misfortune lies on.

Who knows their limits?

They are not honest and just.

Honesty and justness returns, becoming strange and

      unusual.

Virtue returns, becoming weird and strange.

 

The confusion of the people –

Its days have indeed been everlasting.

 

Thus the sage :

Is honest and does not divide,

Is honorable and does not injure,

Is straightforward and does not indulge in excess,

Is bright but does not dazzle.

 

 

Fifty nine

When governing people or doing heaven’s duties,

It is better to be sparing.

 

Now : only when you can be sparing,

This is called early acceptance.

Early acceptance is called doubling your accumulation

      of De.

With a double accumulation of De,

Then everything can be overcome.

When everything can be overcome,

Then no one knows your limits.

When no one knows your limits,

You can possess the nation.

Possessing the mother of the nation,

You can forever endure.

 

This is called having a deep source and a firm

      foundation,

The Way of long life and enduring sight.

 

 

Sixty

Governing a great nation is like cooking a small fish.

 

Because Dao is present in the world,

Its ghosts do not have spirit.

 

Not that its ghosts do not have any spirit,

But their spirit does not injure people.

 

Not only does their spirit not injure people,

The sage also does not injure people.

 

Now : since these two do not injure each other,

Therefore their De merges and returns!

 

 

Sixty one

A great nation is like the lowest places water can flow –

The merging place of the world,

The female of the world.

 

The female always uses stillness to conquer the male.

By using stillness, she becomes lower-than.

 

Therefore : if a great nation is lower-than a small nation,

Then it takes hold of the small nation.

If a small nation is lower-than a great nation,

Then it is taken hold of by the great nation.

 

Therefore : sometimes one nation is lower-than in order

      to take hold of,

Sometimes one nation is lower-than and then it is taken

      hold of.

 

A great nation merely desires to combine livestock and

      people,

A small nation merely desires to get work for its people.

Now : for both nations to each get that which is their

      desire,

It is proper for the great nation to be lower-than.

 

 

Sixty two

That which Daos is the obscure mystery of the ten

      thousand creatures.

This is the treasure of a virtuous person,

And that which is the protection of a person who is not

      virtuous.

 

Beautiful speech can be used in the market,

Respectful behavior can benefit people.

People who are not virtuous,

Why abandon them?

 

Therefore : when inaugurating the son of heaven,

Or installing the three nobles –

Even if you possessed jade disks drawn by a team of

      four horses,                                  

That is not as good as sitting and offering this Way.

 

What was the ancients’ reason that they valued this Way?

Did they not say :

Seek in order to obtain,

Have faults in order to be forgiven?

 

Therefore Dao becomes valuable to the world.

 

 

Sixty three

Act with non-action.

Handle duties with non-interference.

Taste that which is without-flavor.

 

Greatness is insignificant, too much is less.

Repay animosity with De.

 

Plan for the difficult while it is easy.

Act on the great while it is tiny.

In the world, difficult duties certainly start while easy.

In the world, great duties certainly start while tiny.

 

Thus the sage in the end does not act great,

Therefore he can achieve his greatness.

 

Men who make promises lightly, certainly few will trust.

Men who expect most duties to be easy will certainly

      have many difficulties.

 

Thus the sage plans for things to be difficult,

Therefore in the end he is without difficulty!

 

 

Sixty four

What is peaceful is easy to hold.        

What has not yet been revealed is easy to plan for.

What is brittle is easy to shatter.          

What is minute is easy to scatter.

Act on it while it does not yet exist.

Govern them while they are not yet confused.

 

A tree too big to embrace is created from the tiniest

      shoot.

A terrace of nine stories rises from a pile of dirt.

A journey of a thousand miles begins from under the feet.

 

He who acts, ruins it.

He who grasps, loses it.

 

Thus the sage :

Does not act, therefore he does not ruin.

Does not grasp, therefore he does not lose.

 

Citizens are always on the verge of achieving their

      undertakings, yet they ruin them.  

Be as careful in the end as if it was the beginning,

Then you will not ruin your affairs.

 

Thus the sage :

Desires to not desire,

Does not value rare goods,

Learns to not learn.

 

He returns to that which everyone else has passed over,

Thus helping the ten thousand creatures to be naturally

      so,

Yet not daring to act.

 

 

Sixty five

The virtue of the ancients (they who acted in Dao),

Did not use it to enlighten the citizens,

But would have used it to keep them ignorant –

The citizens are hard to govern

Because they have too much knowledge.

 

Therefore : using knowledge to govern the nation

Is the bane of the nation.

Not using knowledge to govern the nation

Is the good fortune of the nation.

He who has knowledge of these two also has them as

      examples.

 

To always understand these examples –

This is called deep and mysterious De.

Deep and mysterious De is so profound! and remote!

That when creatures return, it returns with them!

Then they reach the greatest harmony.

 

 

Sixty six

The reason that rivers and seas can act as kings of the

      100 valleys

Is because they are good at being lower-than them.    

Therefore : they can act as kings of the 100 valleys.

 

Thus the sage :

In desiring to be above the citizens,

He must by means of his speech be lower-than them.

In desiring to be before the citizens,

He must by means of his self be behind them.

 

Thus the sage :

Lives above them, but the citizens are not burdened.

Lives in front of them, but the citizens are not harmed.

Thus the world is pleased to promote him, and does not

      tire of him.

 

Because he does not strive,

Therefore no one in the world can strive against him.

POST-GUODIAN

 

Eleven

Thirty spokes of a wheel share one hub;

In its emptiness exists the usefulness of the cart.

 

Mix water with clay thus making a vessel;

In its emptiness exists the usefulness of the vessel.

 

Cut out doors and windows thus making a room;       

In their emptiness exists the usefulness of the room.

 

Therefore : what exists thus makes a thing profitable;

Emptiness thus makes it useful.

 

 

Twenty six

Serious serves as the source of frivolous.
Stillness serves as the ruler of restlessness.

Thus the noble man travels the entire day,

And does not stray from his wagon.

He is serious, even though glorious sights and feasts

      exist;

He lives above them, like this.

So how could one be the master of ten thousand chariots,

And conduct his self frivolously in the world?    

 

Be frivolous, then lose the source.
Be restless, then lose the rulership.

 

 

Thirty three

He who knows people is wise;

He who knows himself has insight.

 

He who is victorious over people possesses power;

He who is victorious over himself is strong.

 

He who knows he has enough is wealthy;

He who uses force possesses ambition.

 

He who does not lose his place endures;

He who dies yet does not perish has longevity.

 

 

Thirty six

When you are about to gather something,

You must have originally spread it out.

When you are about to weaken something,

You must have originally strengthened it.

When you are about to abandon something,

You must have originally been interested in it.

When you are about to seize something,

You must have originally given it.

 

This is called subtle and obscure insight.

 

What is soft and weak conquers what is hard and strong.

 

Fish can not escape from the deep;

The sharp tools of the nation

Can not be shown to the people.

 

 

Forty

The movement of Dao returns things.

The function of Dao is to weaken things.

 

The ten thousand creatures of the world are created from

      being;

Being is created from non-being.

 

 

Forty two

Dao creates one.

One creates two.

Two creates three.

Three creates the ten thousand creatures.

The ten thousand creatures carry Yin and embrace Yang,

Pouring their Qi together, thus becoming harmonious.

 

That which people detest :

Being alone, orphaned, lonely, and unlucky –

Yet kings and nobles thus name themselves.

 

Therefore : creatures

Sometimes lose, yet they gain;

Sometimes gain, yet they lose.

 

That which people teach, I also teach :

Those who are bullies and hoodlums do not meet their

      natural death.

I will thus become their elder teacher.

 

 

Forty three

The softest things of the world

Overrun the hardest things of the world.

 

Non-being can enter where there is no space in between.

Thus I know that non-action has benefits.

 

The teaching of no-talking,

The benefit of non-action –

Few in the world attain these.

 

 

Fifty

Between coming out into life and entering death,

Followers of life are 3 in 10.

Followers of death are 3 in 10.

People whose lives are merely moving them towards the

      place of death

Are also 3 in 10.

 

Now : what is the reason?

Because they live life for its substance.

 

But I have heard that he who is skilled at taking in life

Can travel the mountains and does not meet rhino or

      tiger,

Can enter a battle not wearing armor or weapons.

The rhino has no place to thrust its horns,

The tiger has no place to use its claws,

The weapon has no place to allow its blade.

 

Now : what is the reason?

Because for him there is no place of death.

 

 

Sixty seven

In the world, all say I am great,

But do not seem to be like everyone else.

Now : only because I am not  like everyone else,

       therefore I can be great.

If I was like everyone else,

Long ago! I would have become insignificant, indeed!

 

Now :  I possess three treasures –

Hold and maintain them.

The first is called compassion,

The second is called economy,

The third is called not daring to act first in the world.

 

With compassion, you can therefore be brave.

With economy, you can therefore expand.

By not daring to act first in the world,

Therefore you can achieve the capacity for leadership.

 

At present, people abandon compassion but also try to be

      brave,

Abandon economy but also try to expand,

Abandon being behind but also try to be first –

This is death!

 

Now : when compassion is used in war, the consequence

      is victory.

When it is used for protection, the consequence is

      strength.

When heaven would help you,

Using compassion it protects you.

 

 

Sixty eight

He who is good at being a scholar is not militant.

He who is good at war does not get angry.

He who is good at conquering the enemy does not

      engage them.

He who is good at making use of people acts lower-than

      them.

 

This is called the De of not striving.

This is called the power of making use of people.

This is called joining the elite of heaven’s ancients,

      indeed!

 

 

Sixty nine

Those who command troops have a saying :

I dare not act like the master, but instead act like a guest.

Dare not advance an inch, but instead retreat a foot.

 

This is called marching without marching,

Seizing without using your arms,

Routing without having an enemy,

Defending without using weapons.

 

There is no misfortune greater than underestimating the

      enemy.

By underestimating the enemy, I nearly lose my

       treasures.

 

Therefore : when armies on opposing sides are evenly

      matched,

Then they who mourn will be victorious!

 

 

Seventy

My words are very easy to understand,

Very easy to practice.

But there is no one in the world who can understand

      them,

There is no one who can practice them.

 

My words possess a lineage,

My duties possess a ruler.

 

Now : only because I am without-knowledge,

Thus I am not understood.

Those who understand me are rare,

Consequently I am one who is valued!

 

Thus the sage wears coarse cloth, but carries jade in his

      heart.

 

 

Seventy one

Knowing that you do not know is honorable!

Not knowing that you know is a sickness!

 

Now : only when you are sick of sickness,

Thus you are not sick.

 

The sage is not sick

Because he is sick of sickness.

Thus he is not sick.

 

 

Seventy two

If the citizens do not fear your authority,

Then a greater authority will arrive!

 

Do not disrespect their dwellings,

Do not despise their livelihood.

 

Now : only because you do not despise them,

Thus they will not tire of you.

 

Thus the sage :

Knows himself but not display himself,

Loves himself but does not exalt himself.

Therefore he leaves that and chooses this.

 

 

Seventy three

When your courage lies in daring,

The consequence is killing.

When your courage lies in not daring,

The consequence is survival.

 

These two choices, they sometimes cause benefit,

      sometimes cause harm.

That which heaven detests – who knows its reasons?

 

The Way of heaven :

Does not strive, yet skillfully achieves its goals.

Does not speak, yet skillfully responds.

Does not summon, yet everything naturally comes to it.

Is certainly unhurried, yet skillfully prepares.

 

Heaven’s net is extremely vast;

It is wide meshed, yet does not fail.

 

 

Seventy four

If the citizens do not fear death,

How can you use death to frighten them?

Assuming you could ensure that the citizens always fear

      death,

And I get hold of those who act strange and unusual and

      kill them,

Then who would be daring?

 

There will always exist an executioner.

Now : to take the place of the executioner to do the

      killing,

This is called taking the place of a great craftsman to

      carve wood.

Now : of those who take the place of a great craftsman to

      carve wood,

Few will not injure their hand!

 

 

Seventy five

The citizens are hungry

Because their superiors eat too much of their taxes.

Thus they are hungry.

 

The citizens are hard to govern

Because their superiors are compelled to take action.

Thus they are hard to govern.

 

The citizens take death lightly

Because they seek the substance of life.

Thus they take death lightly.

 

Now : only he who has no use for being alive

Is virtuous compared to he who values living.

 

 

Seventy six

The people are born (indeed!) soft and weak.

They die (indeed!) hard and inflexible.

The ten thousand creatures, the grass and trees, are born

      (indeed!) soft and fragile.

They die (indeed!) dried and withered.

 

Therefore : that which is hard and inflexible is a follower

      of death.

That which is soft and weak is a follower of life.

 

Thus if a weapon is inflexible, the consequence is defeat.     

If a tree is inflexible, then it snaps.

 

Inflexible and great dwell below.

Soft and weak dwell above.

 

 

Seventy seven

The Way of heaven, how it is just like stretching a bow?

He who is high is pressed down by it.

He who is low is lifted by it.

He who has excess is reduced by it.

He who does not have enough is filled by it.

 

The Way of heaven

Reduces what has excess and fills what does not have

      enough.

The Way of people on the other hand is not like this,

And takes from those who do not have enough in order to

      offer it to those who have too much.

 

Who can have too much and offer it to the world?

Only he who possesses Dao.

 

Thus the sage :

Acts, but is not concerned with the results.

Accomplishes his tasks, but does not dwell on them.

He does not desire to display his virtue.

 

 

Seventy eight

In the world, nothing is softer and weaker than water.

Yet for attacking that which is hard and strong,

There is nothing that can surpass it.

This is because it endlessly replaces itself.

 

Weakness conquers strength.

Softness conquers hardness.

In the world, there is no one who does not know this,

But there is no one who can practice it.

 

Thus the sage says :

Accepting upon oneself the disgrace of the nation

Is called being master of the shrines.

Accepting upon oneself the misfortune of the nation

Is called being king of the world.

 

Honest words seem contrary.

 

Seventy nine

Harmonize a great resentment,

And there must exist some remaining resentment.

How can this be considered good?

 

Thus the sage :

Holds the left side of an agreement,

But does not demand payment of people.

 

Therefore : to have De is to take charge of your

      agreements;

To be without De is to take charge of taking away from

      others.

 

The Way of heaven, while without favor,

Is always with virtuous people.

 

 

Eighty

In a small nation with few citizens :

Ensure that it has the weapons of ten nobles, but does not

      use them.

Ensure that the citizens take death seriously, and do not

      migrate far.

Even though they have boats and carriages, there is no

      place to take advantage of them.

Even though they have armor and weapons, there is no

      place to display them.

 

Ensure that the citizens return to knotting ropes and using

      them,

Find deliciousness in their food,

Beauty in their clothes,

Contentment in their dwellings,

Happiness in their customs.

 

Although neighboring nations overlook one another,

And sounds of roosters and dogs can be heard in one

      another –

The citizens reach old age and die,

And do not come and go between one another.

 

 

Eighty one

True words are not beautiful;

Beautiful words are not true.

 

He who has virtue does not argue;

He who argues does not have virtue.

 

He who knows is not learned;

He who is learned does not know.

 

The sage does not accumulate things –

Since through serving people, the more one has;

Since through giving to people, one has even more.

 

The Way of heaven benefits and does not cause harm.

The Way of the sage acts yet does not strive.

 

 

 

As mentioned above, chapter 2 seems to be a truly “mongrel” chapter,
with characteristics that indicate it belongs to all three layers, and
none of them.  Therefore, it is presented here, separate from the other
layers.

 

Two

In the world, when all know that the action of beauty is

      beautiful, then ugliness ensues.

When all know that the action of good is goodness, then

      not-good ensues.                   

 

Therefore : being and non-being create each other,

Difficult and easy complete each other,

Long and short contrast each other,

High and low lean on each other,

Tone and voice harmonize each other,

Before and after follow each other.

 

Thus the sage :

Lives by using non-action in his duties,

And practicing no-talking in his teachings.

 

The ten thousand creatures arise, but do not have a

      beginning.

Creating but not possessing;

Acting, but not concerned with the results;

Accomplishing tasks, but not dwelling on them.         

 

Now : only because there is no dwelling,

Thus the results do not depart.

 

 

WHAT WOULD THE SAGE DO?

Thus the sage :

Lives by using non-action in his duties,

And practicing no-talking in his teachings.

 

Thus the governing of the sage

Empties their heart/minds, fills their bellies,

Weakens their ambitions, strengthens their bones.

 

The sage is not kind;

Thus the 100 families become as straw dogs to him.

 

Thus the sage :

Puts his self behind others, yet finds his self before them.

Considers his self extraneous, yet his self survives.

Is this not because he has no self-interests?

Therefore he can achieve his self-interests.

 

Thus the sage :

Acts on what is inside, he does not act on what he sees.

Therefore he leaves that and chooses this.

 

Thus the sage :

Embraces the One, thus serving as an example to the

      world –

He does not display himself, therefore he has insight.

Does not consider himself correct, therefore he

      distinguishes himself.

Does not boast about himself, therefore he possesses

      merit.

Does not brag about himself, therefore he endures.

Now : only because he does not strive,

Therefore no one in the world can strive against him.

 

Thus the sage :

Is always good at helping people,

Therefore he does not abandon people.          

Is always good at helping creatures,

Therefore he does not abandon creatures.

This is called following your insight.

 

Thus the sage :

Removes the extremes,

Removes the extravagant and wasteful,

Removes the arrogance.

 

Thus the sage can achieve greatness   

Because he does not act great.

Therefore he can achieve greatness.

 

Thus the sage :

Does not travel, yet knows.

Does not display himself, yet has a reputation.

Does not act, yet accomplishes.

 

 

The sage does not have a constant heart/mind,

Thus the 100 families’ heart/minds become his

      heart/mind.

 

The sage lives in the world, taking it all in.

And so he serves the world, merging with their

      heart/minds.

 

The 100 families all pay attention to their ears and eyes,

And the sage treats them all like his children.

 

Therefore : the sage says –

I use non-action, and the citizens naturally transform.

I cherish stillness, and the citizens naturally become

      honest and just.

I use non-interference, and the citizens naturally become

      wealthy.

I am without-desire, and the citizens naturally return to

      the state of the uncarved block.

 

Thus the sage :

Is honest and does not divide,

Is honorable and does not injure,

Is straightforward and does not indulge in excess,

Is bright but does not dazzle.

 

The sage also does not injure people.

 

Thus the sage in the end does not act great,

Therefore he can achieve his greatness.

 

Thus the sage plans for things to be difficult,

Therefore in the end he is without difficulty!

 

Thus the sage :

Does not act, therefore he does not ruin.

Does not grasp, therefore he does not lose.

 

Thus the sage :

Desires to not desire,

Does not value rare goods,

Learns to not learn.

 

Thus the sage :

In desiring to be above the citizens,

He must by means of his speech be lower-than them.

In desiring to be before the citizens,

He must by means of his self be behind them.

 

Thus the sage :

Lives above them, but the citizens are not burdened.

Lives in front of them, but the citizens are not harmed.

Thus the world is pleased to promote him, and does not

      tire of him.

 

Thus the sage wears coarse cloth, but carries jade in his

      heart.

 

The sage is not sick

Because he is sick of sickness.

Thus he is not sick.

 

Thus the sage :

Knows himself but not display himself,

Loves himself but does not exalt himself.

Therefore he leaves that and chooses this.

 

Thus the sage :

Acts, but is not concerned with the results.

Accomplishes his tasks, but does not dwell on them.

He does not desire to display his virtue.

 

Thus the sage says :

Accepting upon oneself the disgrace of the nation

Is called being master of the shrines.

Accepting upon oneself the misfortune of the nation

Is called being king of the world.

 

Thus the sage :

Holds the left side of an agreement,

But does not demand payment of people.

 

The sage does not accumulate things –

Since through serving people, the more one has;

Since through giving to people, one has even more.

 

The Way of the sage acts yet does not strive.

    1.F.

    1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
    effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
    works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
    Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
    electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
    contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
    or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
    intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
    other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
    cannot be read by your equipment.

    1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
    of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
    Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
    Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

    defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
    receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

    received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
    with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
    with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
    lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
    or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
    opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
    the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
    without further opportunities to fix the problem.

    trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
    providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

    the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
    or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
    additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any

    Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

    Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
    electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
    computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
    exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
    from people in all walks of life.

    Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
    assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
    goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
    remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
    and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
    generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
    Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
    Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
    www.gutenberg.org

    Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
    Literary Archive Foundation

    Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
    spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
    increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
    freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
    array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
    ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
    status with the IRS.

    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
    charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
    States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
    considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
    with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
    where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
    DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
    state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
    have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
    against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
    approach us with offers to donate.

    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
    any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
    outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

    Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
    methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
    ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
    donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

    Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

    Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
    Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
    freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
    distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
    volunteer support.

    Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
    editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
    the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
    necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
    edition.

    Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
    facility: www.gutenberg.org

    This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
    including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
    Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
    subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
