I am not amused
I be like
I can't believe it
I could be wrong
I could swear
I didn't do it
I didn't see that
I don't care
I donno
I forgot
I give up
I got your back
I had a crazy dream
I hate when that happens
I have an idea
I just might
I like this more than
I love this
I love you
I m prettier than this man
I made it that way
I pity the fool
I planned that
I quit
I see nothing

I'll ask nicely
I'll be back
I'll get right on it
I'll let you know
I'll think about it
I'm God and you're not
I'm God who the hell are you
I'm beginning to wonder
I'm bored
I'm busy
I'm done
I'm feeling nice today
I'm gonna smack someone
I'm good you good
I'm grieved
I'm impressed
I'm in suspense
I'm not dead yet
I'm not sure
I'm off today
I'm on a roll
I'm the boss
I'm thrilled
I'm tired of this
