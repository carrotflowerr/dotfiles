The ESOTERICA Library
Here is a curated list of what I take to be the most essential, accessible, scholarly and fundamental texts for the
study of Western Esoterica up to around 1650. This list is by no means exhaustive, far from it by design. But,
I’ve selected texts based on their being foundational, in print, in English, ‘affordable’ and not overly
specialized. The Amazon affiliate links mean I will receive a slight margin if you buy a book. This list will be
updated. Last Update: April 2024.
I discuss the methodology of the creation of this list in the episode here: https://youtu.be/1-S95SMkBVw
JJS.

Start Here

https://amzn.to/3PO7kyE
Read through this text cover to cover.
Then either (1) build out a robust library of Primary and Secondary sources in the
next two lists and/or (2) deep dive your interests, e.g., Gnosticism, Kabbalah,
Historical Magic, etc., with the reference sections below:
