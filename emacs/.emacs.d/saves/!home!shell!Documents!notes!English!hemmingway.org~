 Hemingway was a direct writer. He didn't mince his words, or obscure anything through metaphor. He put himself in his work, including his insecurities. The psychological complex's of Santiago are inherited from Hemingway. The isolated expression of Santiago on his boat *is* the expression Hemingway, put into paper and ink. 



* The Old Man

The state in which we know Santiago is fragmented. His body degrades as his spirit grows. His spirit is great, however has no motivation. He is a hermit, yet he is lonely. He's stoic, but frequently overcome with an emotion only the sea can hold.

** Spirit
"A man can be destroyed but not defeated"

Santiago's motivation for his acetic lifestyle are complex. We get constant reminders of his failing physical state, along with his mental struggles. Both of which are directly a concequense of his sea-bound isolation. In Sartre's Being and Nothingness, he describes the ego-defining relationship between an individual and their **other.** He argued people exist as much to themselves as they are seen by others. When Santiago isolates himself, he is trying to take back the power that other people's perceptions hold. 
This makes sense, given the ridicule of most of the townsfolk.

** Struggle
Most of the old mans interactions, and all of his bonding, comes from mutual suffering. His relationship to the boy, the townsfolk, and the sea all exist under the backdrop of this struggle. But why is he engaging in this masochism? Is he, as Dostoevsky describes "loving our illnesses?" I think his motivation has 3 heads.
*** 1) To prove himself  
    Santiago really does not care about most people's opinions. In this way he's a stoic. Besides contributing to his isolation, his motivation is almost entirely intrinsic. When he wants to prove himself, he wants to prove his skill to himself. Beyond just proving his skills, he's proving that his age is no concern. It proves that his mental fortitude really is more valuable than his physical condition. In a small way too, I think he wants to appear skillful to the boy.
*** 2) To distract himself
   While talking to himself he continually reels his thoughts back in towards a single-mined goal, many times being the goal of catching the marlin. In this, he doesn't have to think about his past, his late wife, the boy, or his own death. In a way, this single mindedness is commendable. Again, it's reminiscent of the Stoic ideals. But sadly, it's used as a coping mechanism. This makes it the object of desire which Lacan calls **objet petit a.** A core attribute of this desire is that it is undefinable, and unobtainable. In the same way that Don Giovanni chases an aesthetic ideal, or an ascetic monk chases god, the old man chases the marlin. His struggle is the self-flagellation of the monk. 
*** 3) To kill himself
   Lacan infamously said **"all drives are death drives."**  Meaning that every desire has a relationship with the desire for an interaction with death. Santiago's relationship with death is described here perfectly. He doesn't want to die, not at all. He wants to flirt with death. The same masochistic pleasure that comes in flirting, **"will this romantic gesture be reciprocated or will I perish?"**, is seen with the old man. He wants the possibility of death, along with the chance of beating it, and overcoming death. 



* The Sea
To paraphrase the famous question; "if a man is stranded at sea, but no one knows he is there, was he ever stranded?"
What then, does the sea do for him? Does the sea hear the old man? 




--------------------------------------------------
**** everything below is outline:
will turn each thought into paragraph?

1) Writing style
- blunt writing. for general audience
- defensive writing. defensive in the same way the old man is.

2) 


 
Spirit:
	- "A man can be destroyed but not defeated."

	-  physical destruction (exhaustion, injury, loss of the marlin)
	-  mental resilience 

	- was he "defeated"?

Pride
	- Examine Santiago's pride. Is it a flaw (hubris) that leads him too far out?
	- Why does he do it?
	- Consider how Hemingway portrays pride â€“ is it condemned or celebrated?

Respect & The marlin

	- relationship
	-  Explore the language he uses when thinking about or speaking to the fish.
    	- "unworthy" sharks.
	- view of nature and his place within it.

Symbolism in the Sea

	  -The Marlin:  nobility, the ideal opponent, nature's beauty and power, the things that kills him (death drive) objet a.
    
	  -The Sharks: Could represent the destructive forces of nature, the harsh realities of the world, critics, or the forces that tear down achievements.

	  - The Lions: Recurring in Santiago's dreams, they could represent lost youth, strength, harmony with nature, Africa (a place of memory/longing), or peace.
