The famous conseracy poster reads "I want to believe" in big bold text below a blurry picture of a UFO.

This is an incredibly weird quote to me.

The act of believing it framed as a virtue that exists despite truth. It's almost like the religious virtue of faith.

It's saying the quiet part out loud.
The skeptic voices their complains and the consiracist goes "yes, yes. I know. But you aren't getting the point. Nothing causes my belief. To me, things start with belief and move upward."
