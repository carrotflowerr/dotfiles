As of the time of writing this, (Fri May 30) tech bros have been throwing out this idea of prompt theory which goes like this:
1) technological advacement will eventually lead to sentient ai.
2) if true, we are likely a simulation from another society.
3) life could then very well be simply a prompt from a being to an AI.
