A sea-side dolloptree
A candle lit hymn

The warmth of a cave,
the cave of a soul.

The cave has a bear,
The bear is named bluegrass.

Bluegrass sees in technicolor
and hears in whispered winds.
He fears the sea.
He eats wet dreams.

The trees are a bistro
and the sky is a new trend.
The bugs are his forsworn
and the mud is his punk venue.

he knows it's time, to hibernate, but he drags his feet.
Back to the cave,
back as a story.
back as the memory.
