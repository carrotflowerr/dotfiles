/“We feel free because we lack the very language to articulate our unfreedom.”/ - Slavoj Žižek


We speak about language as something that is only extrinsically controlled by a separate, intentional figure. But language is dictated by many things; environment, knowledge, and even the structure of the language itself. The typical understanding is that thought has no limits, and that extends to language. The only 'real' limits being the arbitrary limits we place onto it for social balance. But the limits are not just arbitrary. These other limits govern not only our words, but our potential for thought.


*** Importance of Language
/"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent."/ - [cite:@witt], Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus

Communication is not a metaphysical exchange of pure information, it's clarification of the natural structure of the world. Wittgenstein argued that language starts as describing the most basic facts of the world as propositions, and it follows the structure as it gets more high level. The more abstract our descriptions get the less our language directly pertains to experience. It would make sense then to claim that the abstraction of un-freedom, as Žižek claims, is limited by the experiential lack of freedom. The un-freedom feels like freedom because freedom is categorically abstract to someone who has never felt it.

The initial reaction would be this: "But can't we conceive of things that we cannot put into words? Isn't this an understanding that is not limited by language? Who's to say that you need to be able to talk about something to understand it?"

Conception of something doesn't imply understanding of it. In the same way, seeing a tree's categorical attributes only mean your conception of them, until put into words. /“there is language only because there is discourse, not the other way around”/ - Heidegger, Being and Time. The ability to articulate understanding comes before the understanding. Language without the ability to participate in discourse /(Rede)/ would become meaningless.

*** Limitations of language

The control of language, then, has implications far beyond just /what you can say./ It is the control of thought itself. I don't mean censorship, I mean cognition. Again, the limitations are not only extrinsic (unless you count the world as extrinsic). If you don't buy this argument, there are many practical examples of the effect language has on ones perception of the world.

The Guugu Yimithirr is an aboriginal language in Australia. It comes with a special quirk of always speaking about places using cardinal directions. For example, they may say something like "can you hand me my bag from over east." Native speakers were found to be able to effortlessly tell the directions at all times. The "eternal return" conception of time the Mayans famously had is notable as well. They talked about time as a loop, or as one thing happening at once. This would not be a conception of time you could have without description. 

*** Power
So we understand /why/ we cannot express our unfreedom, but who/what holds this power? In which direction does this limitation come from? The limitations we've talked about have been limitations of the environment. Then it may make sense that controlling ones environment controls what they are able to understand.

Removing ones conception of discourse would seriously impair their understanding. For example, the famous case of Genie, who had little to no human contact for the first 13 years of her life. She was, of course, never taught a language. Her case is one of the most important in the study of linguistic development. I think her

but if the world and the words we use to describe it were entirely separate, people should be able to develop

im starting to think this isn't a good example.
The self-moderation of the panoptigon's prisoner applies to language as well.

So when we are deprived of something, we are also being deprived of the very conception of it. On the surface level, this seems obvious. If you never show someone a butterfly they would not be able to describe it. 

*** Lingua Franca
Lingua Franca refers to English as a bridge language. A bridge language is a language that is learned by non-native speakers for some common purpose.[cite:@franca] This could be diplomacy, travel, but for English, trade. Think how wide the English empire's trade network was. The point is that English is a language heavily influenced by trade and commerce. We speak about almost everything in terms of ownership and value.

The English genitive ('s words) is by far the most common way to describe any given noun. Russian, for example, doesn't have a direct verb for "to have." So does this development limit the Western conception of a non-capital based economic system? I think so. Do other languages, specifically languages with a past history of communal, living have better language to describe it? Did their language predispose them towards a certain economic history? It's out of the scope of my point to argue that here, but it would be a fascinating conclusion.
