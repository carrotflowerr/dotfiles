** Intro
I was sitting in a critical thinking course and the professor was explaining the logical form motus ponents.

{\displaystyle P} implies     
{\displaystyle Q}.     
{\displaystyle P} is true. Therefore,     
{\displaystyle Q} must also be true.    

as an example, he said the following:
"If the floor is wet, it is raining.
The floor is wet,
so it must be raining."

A student objects:
"Well someone could have just spilled water."

This is an example of why I find many philisohical takes unsatisfying.
