<p>A terminal-based web browser in Nim.[1]  Has acceptable (YMMV) CSS

also use various protocols other than http(s) such as (s)ftp, gopher,
gemini, ...<p>Chawan started out as a w3m clone, and the UI still resembles it.
However, the architecture has turned out quite different, with pages
loaded in separate processes, and protocol/file type handling separated
out into external binaries.  An interesting result is that you can even
register decoders for custom inline image formats, although practical
use cases of this are rather minimal.<p>There is a gallery showcasing some websites being rendered here:

<p>Hello HN!<p>I've been working on Canine for about a year now. It started when I was sick of paying the overhead of using stuff like Heroku, Render, Fly, etc to host some web apps that I've built. At one point I was paying over $400 a month for hosting these in the cloud. Last year I moved all my stuff to Hetzner.<p>For a 4GB machine, the cost of various providers:<p>Heroku = $260
Fly.io = $65
Render = $85
Hetzner = $4<p>(This problem gets a lot worse when you need > 4GB)<p>The only downside of using Hetzner is that there isn’t a super straightforward way to do stuff like:<p>- DNS management / SSL certificate management
- Team management
- Github integration<p>But I figured it should be easy to quickly build something like Heroku for my Hetzner instance. Turns out it was a bit harder than expected, but after a year, I’ve made some good progress<p>The best part of Canine, is that it also makes it trivial to host any helm chart, which is available for basically any open source project, so everything from databases (e.g. Postgres, Redis), to random stuff like torrent tracking servers, VPN’s endpoints, etc.<p>Open source: <a href=\"https://github.com/czhu12/canine\">https://github.com/czhu12/canine</a>

<p>I've always found it cool to be in roles where I can help a younger generation learn skills to have a bright future. That role is something I do in a few ways (as a parent, robotics mentor, school board advisor and Sunday school teacher) and I suspect most HN readers share the same role and appreciation. And for developing software skills, it was obvious that both the students and I had to have a productive software environment where we could work together. That theme of experienced/inexperienced engineers working together is the context in which I created `dk` as a scripting tool.<p>My testing ground has been students with one or two AP CS courses (high school computer science in the US), some of whom interned with me. I had to tackle a few problems:<p>- The development environment had to be simple to setup and the programming language couldn't be complicated
- The recognition that writing small, easily testable units of work (ex. \"scripts\") has been the only way I've found for very junior programmers to develop a large application
- Cheap, locked-down development hardware (ex. school computers with limited RAM and no Administrator privileges) is sometimes used for deployment to cheap hardware targets (ex. hand-me-down Android tablets)<p>My solution was to write a standalone binary called `dk` that uses scripts as the atom of work, cross-compiles to standalone executables, and downloads the runtimes and sysroots it needs on-demand. It sits roughly in the same space as Python and Go.<p>`dk` is available for Windows, macOS and Linux/glibc host machines with a growing list of cross-compilation targets.
Your `dk` scripts are written in an almost complete subset of OCaml 4: all `dk` scripts are OCaml, but not all OCaml code can run in `dk`. The other differences from conventional OCaml are that `dk` comes with a large library included, and that I treat any feature as buggy if the feature does not work on all supported OS-es.<p>The above origin of `dk` is admittedly odd (and abbreviated), so I was not expecting that `dk` would now be a general-purpose scripting tool. Yet it is. I can wrap, re-use and organize most of my hand-written software as a set of `dk` scripts.<p>Fair warning: The cross-compilation support in `dk` has had a recent overhaul and not every bug is closed. The error messages suck (you have to scroll up to see the root cause and resolution) but they will improve. Some progress bars are missing. There are also a few experimental features ... `uv`-style imports and an interactive interpreter are the big ones ... which are purposely under-documented because I am worried about `dk`'s API surface.<p>But it still works well, and you can see some real applications in the Examples section. I'd love if you could give it a kick in the tires and give `dk` some feedback! The issue list is at <<a href=\"https://github.com/diskuv/dk/issues\">https://github.com/diskuv/dk/issues</a>>.</p>

I spent a weekend seeing if I could recapture some of that INT 13H VGA magic using today's web tech, but with the old-school constraints of doing it from scratch.<p>The result is this portfolio of ten classic effects running in a single HTML file. It's all vanilla JavaScript writing to a <canvas> element, with no external libraries. It was a fun challenge to implement things like:<p>* The color palette cycling and smooth fading in the Plasma demo.
* The buffer-averaging algorithm for the Fire effect to make the flames feel more natural.
* The distance-based texture crossfading in the Tunnel to create the illusion of flying through different sections.
* A 2D scalar field for the Metaballs to calculate the surface normals for that classic blended, metallic look (I did the best I could with the given constraints).<p>It was a great exercise in getting back to first principles and a reminder of how much those early demo programmers could accomplish with so little. I hope it brings back some good memories for others who grew up with this stuff.<p>I'd love to hear about your favorite classic demos or if there are any other iconic effects you think would be a fun challenge to add.<p>Cheers!</p>
