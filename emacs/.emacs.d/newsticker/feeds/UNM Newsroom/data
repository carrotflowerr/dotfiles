<p>Held at Tamaya Resort in Bernalillo, the conference included more than 520 economists from around the world. The conference helps facilitate networking and collaboration opportunities, enabling researchers to connect with peers and mentors, forge collaborations, and build long-term relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=\"https://www.aere.org/\">AERE</a> was founded in 1979 as a means for exchanging ideas, stimulating research, and promoting graduate training in environmental and resource economics, and is geared toward mentorship and professional development programs, particularly for graduate students and young scholars while helping to provide support for their career growth. AERE currently has over 1,000 members from more than 30 nations, coming from academic institutions, the public sector, and private industry.</p>

<p>The University of New Mexico <a href=\"https://econ.unm.edu/\">Department of Economics</a> played a key role in the planning of the conference and had a strong contingent of more than 25 with UNM connections participating. This group included research professors as well as current and former students who have gone on to positions at other universities and organizations, and several who have been connected to the department for more than 30 years including Professor Emerita <a href=\"https://econ.unm.edu/people/faculty/profile/janie-chermak.html\">Janie Chermak</a> and Regent&rsquo;s Professor <a href=\"https://econ.unm.edu/people/faculty/profile/robert-berrens.html\">Bob Berrens</a>.</p>

<p>Environmental and resource economics has garnered more attention over the decades, but it didn&rsquo;t start out that way. Originally, economists interested in environmental issues started out as agricultural, land, mineral and or forest economists. As environmental issues became bigger topics in the 1970s and 80s, the name of environmental economics emerged out of that.</p>

<p>UNM Economics Department, though small in size, has played an important role, with pioneers in the field who called UNM home. Their influence continues today in the faculty&rsquo;s research, which tackles critical New Mexican, Southwest, and world challenges&mdash;water, wildfire, energy transitions, environmental health, and climate impacts&mdash; through cutting-edge, interdisciplinary methods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">&ldquo;The thing that I would emphasize is the group that we have, because it&#39;s important to have critical mass. If you&#39;re one person exploring environmental and resource issues by yourself, it&#39;s hard to make headway. But if you can have five or six faculty members working on a related set of broader issues, then over time and as a community with that critical mass, that&#39;s how you make impact and how there&#39;s growth and those ideas and skill sets grow from the collaboration in the community and the group. And that happens both in place and across place.&quot;</span></span></strong></em></p>

<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">&ndash; Regent&#39;s&nbsp;Professor&nbsp;Bob Berrens</span></span></strong></em><span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite its size, UNM had a strong group at the conference. It was through UNM&rsquo;s group and Chermak&#39;s efforts, along with support from UNM and the <a href=\"https://artsci.unm.edu/\">College of Arts and Sciences</a>, to be able to secure the AERE 2025 Summer Conference here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see the size of this national organization and there&#39;s also a world organization. I&#39;m stunned at the size of the conference,&rdquo; said Berrens. &ldquo;If you would&#39;ve attended one of these 30 years ago, there was only just at that time sort of a fledgling field in environmental and resource economics. However, the University of New Mexico already had a foothold. Despite being a relatively small program, it has been able to sustain that through time. It&#39;s not something I created, but just been a part of. I&#39;m very proud to have been part of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&#39;s what has made the UNM Department of Economics fairly unique to create an environmental resource program in a small department says Berrens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Ph.D. was in agriculture and resource economics. Janie&#39;s was in mineral economics. But I think both of us knew at grad school we would go and work on environmental resource issues. So, I was trained as an agricultural economist and she was trained as a mineral economist, and that was common for people 30 to 35 years ago.&rdquo; Distinguished Professor Emeritus David Brookshire and Professor Emeritus H. Stuart Burness, both early environmental and resource economists themselves, played a role in hiring Berrens and Chermak in the early 1990s.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s conference brought together experts from different sectors including academia, government, and the private sectors, to discuss policy implications and practical applications of environmental and resource economics, informing decision-making.&nbsp;It covered a broad range of topics, including energy, climate change, pollution, minerals, endangered species, water resources, natural resource management, and more, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Research presented ranged from Resilient Energy Economies, Understanding the Macroeconomic Implications of Large-Scale Climate Change Risk, Climate Change &ndash; Modeling, Environmental Health, Agriculture - Developing Countries, Urban Water Pricing and Climate Change &ndash; Policy to name a few. Urban Water Pricing featured research from UNM Ph.D. candidate Nahid Samimi titled <em>Quantifying Heterogeneity in the Price Elasticities of Urban Water Demand: The Case of a Metropolitan Area in the US Southwest</em>. Her mentor is UNM Associate Professor <a href=\"https://econ.unm.edu/people/faculty/profile/jingjing-wang.html\">Jingjing Wang</a>, who is also the Associate Director of UNM&rsquo;s interdisciplinary graduate Water Resources Program.</p>

<p>Reflecting the breadth of topics, Assistant Professor Yuting Yang presented her research titled <em>Optimal Solar Capacity Investment under Varying Net Metering Structures</em>, while Assistant Professor <em>Xiaoyang Wang presented his research titled When is Nickel Worth a Quarter:The Impact of the 2022 LME Nickel Short Squeeze</em>.</p>

<p>Another UNM graduate student participant was Ahmed Amine Jawhari, who presented&nbsp; <em>Willingness-to-Pay for Less Wildfire Smoke? Unpacking Uncertainty, Consequentiality, and Prescribed Burning Acceptance in the Western US</em>. Jawhari&rsquo;s research discussed whether or not citizens were willing to accept less wildfire smoke from prescribed burns rather than much more smoke from a full blown wildfire. UNM Associate Professor and Regent&rsquo;s Lecturer <a href=\"https://econ.unm.edu/people/faculty/profile/benjamin-jones.html\">Benjamin Jones</a> and Berrens are his mentors.</p>

<p>Along the lines of wildfire, a plenary session titled The Changing Risk and Burden of Wildfire, garnered significant interest on the opening day of the conference. It highlighted wildfire risk and how it is rapidly changing in the U.S. and many other countries. The session provided tools and insights from economics, in combination with data and models from the natural sciences, remote sensing, and machine learning. This combination is proving critical in understanding this changing risk and how we might respond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing that I would emphasize is the group that we have, because it&#39;s important to have critical mass. If you&#39;re one person exploring environmental and resource issues by yourself, it&#39;s hard to make headway,&rdquo; said Berrens. &ldquo;But if you can have five or six faculty members working on a related set of broader issues, then over time and as a community with that critical mass, that&#39;s how you make impact and how there&#39;s growth and those ideas and skill sets grow from the collaboration in the community and the group. And that happens both in place and across place.</p>

<p>&quot;What we&rsquo;re watching at the conference is that network come together and being hosted here at New Mexico, which is great, but the most important thing is to have that critical mass and community inside a department.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mission of the Strategic Data Project is to transform the use of data in education to improve student achievement. The project seeks to facilitate better access to appropriately analyzed data, which allows academic leaders to better diagnose issues, develop solutions, and monitor the results of implementing these solutions, emphasizing data governance and accessibility.</p>

<p>The 18-month fellowship kicks off at the end of July, when Orozco and Villalobos Melendez will travel to Cambridge, Mass., for the Strategic Data Project Minority Serving Institution Orientation. There, they will have the chance to interact with the representatives from the other institutions in the program.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This should align well with the work we are already aiming to do at UNM to improve our data governance and data accessibility framework,&rdquo; Orozco said.</p>

<p>The orientation and subsequent gatherings and activities are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>

<p>Orozco became OIA director in January. OIA, based in the Office of Academic Affairs, is the official source for reported metrics and aggregated data at UNM. OIA generates reports and datasets for a variety of uses, including federal compliance reporting, state reporting, and internal recordkeeping and analytics. &nbsp;It also generates and maintains the Official Student Enrollment Reports, as well as aggregated Factbook information on faculty, staff and UNM&rsquo;s four branch campuses.</p>

<p>With the SDP MSI fellowship, Orozco is looking forward to learning from peer institutions to improve data access transparency at UNM. She is also eager to connect with other campuses on data literacy programming, and developing data communities at institutions of higher education.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This fellowship will provide us with a multi-institutional framework where we can learn best practices from other universities &mdash; both what has worked for them and what hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Orozco said that she will take insights she gains from the fellowship and use that knowledge to improve UNM&rsquo;s data presentation and access, which is part of an ongoing effort that includes revamping some of the dashboards and implementing increased education and awareness on how the campus community can better locate and utilize the data the University collects.</p>

<p>Villalobos Melendez will represent UNM-Taos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am honored and very excited to have been selected as a Strategic Data Project (SDP) Fellow at the Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University,&rdquo; said Villalobos Melendez. &ldquo;This fellowship connects me to a dynamic network of data professionals dedicated to enhancing the effective use of data in higher education.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looks forward to deepening her analytical skills and adopting innovative data strategies that enhance student success and support the institutional goals at UNM-Taos, particularly as they apply to the Native population in northern New Mexico.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fellowship project will focus specifically on a comprehensive analysis of our institutional data related to Indigenous students,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;By examining critical factors such as enrollment patterns, program success rates, and retention, this work aims to guide meaningful actions and strengthen our student support systems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ultimately, Villalobos Melendez believes the insights and tools she gains through this experience will enhance the data-informed culture on campus. But, most importantly, she is &ldquo;eager to bring back fresh, impactful strategies and approaches that directly benefit our students and community.&rdquo;</p>

These are just a few of the most notable mass shootings that have occurred in America&#39;s public schools over the last 25 years. For parents, this violence&nbsp;represents a nightmare that has unfortunately become a near-weekly reality, especially since 2022. With 50 million children attending more than 95,000 public high schools nationwide&nbsp;each year, ensuring school safety is a top priority for everyone.</p>

<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">Since Columbine, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/school-shootings-database/?itid=sf_school-shootings_toptable\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post</a>&nbsp;has recorded 428 school shootings, which have resulted in over 700 students being injured or killed and&nbsp;nearly 395,000 kids being directly affected by gun violence. An astonishing $2 billion has been spent on school police and related interventions, such as cameras, metal detectors&nbsp;and threat assessments, since 1999. Despite this expenditure, some studies suggest that these measures can be ineffective and may even cause more harm than good. However, new research from the University of New Mexico offers an evidence-backed alternative for keeping students safe:<em><strong>&nbsp;School Psychologists</strong></em>.</p>

<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><span data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\">Professor Maryam Ahranjani from the <a href=\"https://lawschool.unm.edu/\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">University of New Mexico School of Law</a> recently published the research in the Nevada Law Journal. Titled&nbsp;<i><a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://news.unm.edu/_gallery/get_file/?file_id=68484d6f3d633284e0d5b371&amp;file_ext=.pdf&amp;page_id=&amp;ir=1\" id=\"OWA17daadd4-d566-e1e6-1dfa-23a80f8815bb\" originalsrc=\"https://news.unm.edu/_gallery/get_file/?file_id=68484d6f3d633284e0d5b371&amp;file_ext=.pdf&amp;page_id=&amp;ir=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Original URL: https://news.unm.edu/_gallery/get_file/?file_id=68484d6f3d633284e0d5b371&amp;file_ext=.pdf&amp;page_id=&amp;ir=1. Click or tap if you trust this link.\">Unarresting School Safety</a></i>&nbsp;her article&nbsp;</span><span>explores the concept of school safety broadly, addressing psychological and educational safety as well as the protection of student rights.&nbsp;</span><span>She shares the</span><span>&nbsp;story of a high school junior, Amara Harris, who had a run-in with school police</span><span>&nbsp;in which she was falsely accused of stealing AirPods</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>The article</span><span>&nbsp;evaluates the costs and benefits associated with having on-site school resource officers (SRO</span><span>s</span><span>) and other campus policing strategies, while also discussing the potential for school psychologists to play a more significant role in ensuring student safety.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\">&ldquo;If you think about the role of school psychologists, they are very important, increasingly more since COVID,&quot; she said.&nbsp;&ldquo;In the article, I talk about how the law currently supports psychologists&rsquo; role and how they could further support the safety of children in schools, broadly defined.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span>She defines safety broadly because the relatively infrequent instances of mass violence are overshadowed by much more frequent student safety concerns.</span></p>

<p>Research shows the policing &#39;safety&#39;&nbsp;measures have a high cost (physical, emotional, educational, constitutional), often outweighing the benefits, especially for black and brown children or children with disabilities. While some argue to remove police from&nbsp;schools completely,&nbsp;Ahranjani takes a middle ground approach,&nbsp;scaling back the presence of police and restrictive policing measures, and instead giving psychologists, who are better trained in mental health,&nbsp;a more vital platform to intervene. According to her research, psychologists help students build resilience, connect with resources, and contribute to a child&#39;s daily needs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Psychologists address real daily safety needs that children have &ndash; food insecurity, housing instability, health issues affecting their learning &ndash; those things&nbsp;are threats to their safety more so daily than anything else,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The article also examines the connection between the school-to-prison pipeline and the role that officers may play in it. According to Ahranjani, evidence indicates that contact with officers early in life can lead to later criminal behavior. &quot;<span>Black and Brown children, kids with disabilities, children in foster care, are much more likely to have contact with school police officers and to be disciplined, and that&rsquo;s a real problem,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00;\">&quot;School psychologists occupy a unique position in terms of potentially interrupting the harm caused by school policing for several reasons. First, they provide front-line support to students, so they know better than other school actors how policing and &ldquo;safety&rdquo; measures affect children&rsquo;s sense of physical and emotional safety at school. Second, their special professional training and experience sensitizes them to see the signs of harm and facilitates their ability to resolve conflicts. Third, their positionality within public school systems as highly skilled, well-paid, and respected professionals may mean that their concerns carry more weight than other stakeholders. Fourth, school psychologists&rsquo; ethical obligations under The Professional Standards of the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) mandate that they stand up for students and school communities. Finally, most states and the District of Columbia have&nbsp;passed legislation around school safety that either explicitly invites school psychologists to be partners or provides entry points for them to facilitate training, collaborate with school resource officers (SROs) in addressing safety concerns, and sound the warning bell when they have concerns about how students are treated by SROs and other adults.&quot;</span></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\">This&nbsp;research is&nbsp;significant&nbsp;to Ahranjani, who experienced a mass shooting at her own&nbsp;elementary school&nbsp;</span><span>nearly&nbsp;</span><span>40 years ago&nbsp;in her&nbsp;Chicago suburb&nbsp;when she was 11 years old and in middle school. The groundwork&nbsp;</span><span>for this particular article</span><span>&nbsp;started taking form in&nbsp;early 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. Ahranjani and others formed a group to examine the role of school resource officers. This initiative attracted local media attention and caught the interest of Dr. Lisa Peterson, a school psychologist and director of the School Psychology Program at New Mexico State University. This collaboration led to Ahranjani speaking at conferences and connecting with professionals in the field, ultimately resulting in the creation of this article.</span></p>

<p><span data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\">&ldquo;After having done a lot of work with school psychologists in the last couple of years, I have learned more, appreciated more the work they do, and&nbsp;</span><span>advocate for the</span><span>&nbsp;support they deserve in our schools,&quot; she said.&nbsp;&ldquo;They would like to do more work around safety, collaborate more with officers on their campuses.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\">The bottom line: Fewer SROs and more school psychologists.&nbsp;Ahranjani hopes to expand on&nbsp;this research&nbsp;by writing a book on school policing in the future. &quot;I hope everyone, including those who believe police are essential in schools, will approach&nbsp;</span><span>these</span><span>&nbsp;ideas with an open mind because&nbsp;the research is clear,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</span></p>

Sharon Erickson Nepstad, a distinguished professor in the <a href=\"https://sociology.unm.edu/\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Department of Sociology &amp; Criminology</a> at The University of New Mexico, is heading overseas next spring for research after&nbsp;being awarded a prestigious grant&nbsp;at the <a href=\"https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/about-us/nobel-institute/\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Norwegian Nobel Institute</a> in Oslo, Norway. &nbsp;</p>

<p>While she originally applied for a&nbsp;Fulbright Scholar Fellowship Program in September 2024 at Norway&#39;s Nobel Institute for Advanced International Studies and&nbsp;was&nbsp;later approved by several expert panels and the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board, the U.S. State Department terminated the fellowship for allegedly violating one of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s executive orders. However, the Norwegian office and the European Fulbright Commissions offered her and other recipients a &lsquo;Plan B&rsquo; scholarship, a <em>U.S.-Norwegian Fulbright Foundation&nbsp;grant</em>, which will allow Nepstad to do research at the Nobel Institute in the spring of 2026.</p>

<p>&quot;While I was deeply disappointed that my fellowship had been terminated, I am thrilled to be able to do my research, nonetheless. I&rsquo;m elated that Fulbright Norway is choosing to resist this violation of academic freedom and support us so we can continue our work,&quot; Nepstad said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nepstad&#39;s research area is in peace studies and social movements. While in Norway, she will work on her new project&nbsp;titled:&nbsp;<em>The Price of Peace: Relinquishing the Social Benefits of Enemies,&nbsp;</em>and in the archives at the Nobel Institute, the organization that grants the Nobel Peace Prize.<em>&nbsp;&quot;</em><span>I am working on a book that explores the allure of enemy dynamics and the social benefits that groups derive from being in conflict. To successfully move past a conflict and establish peace, groups have to relinquish these enemy dynamics,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Nepstad will be conducting case studies to explore:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>How do groups resist the pull to perpetuate enemy dynamics during a conflict?</li>
	<li>How do groups dismantle enemy dynamics in the aftermath of a conflict to make sustainable peace possible?</li>
	<li>What challenges or obstacles do they face in transforming enmity?</li>
	<li>How do groups substitute the social benefits that enemies previously provided?</li>
</ul>

<p>The 100,000&nbsp;Norwegian Kroner ($10,000) grant will provide&nbsp;funding to cover Nepstad&#39;s&nbsp;airfare and living expenses while staying in Oslo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;I chose my academic path when I was living in West Germany and working for an international peace organization. During that time, the Berlin Wall fell&nbsp;to everyone&rsquo;s astonishment. I decided that I wanted to attend graduate school to study how people living in authoritarian conditions could nonviolently transform their political systems. That is what I&rsquo;ve been doing since I finished my Ph.D. in 1996,&quot; said Nepstad.&nbsp;&quot;To study at the Nobel Institute is an honor and the culmination of my career goal of contributing to a deeper understanding of nonviolent social movements. In addition, as the granddaughter of a Norwegian immigrant, I&rsquo;m grateful for the opportunity to learn more about my own cultural heritage.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nepstad, who also serves as the associate dean for Reserach and Graduate Studies in the <a href=\"https://artsci.unm.edu/\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">College of Arts &amp;&nbsp;Sciences</a>, has published seven&nbsp;books and dozens of articles.&nbsp;<span>She&#39;s been with UNM since 2009 after holding faculty positions at several other universities.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-teams=\"true\">&quot;As interim associate dean for research&nbsp;and graduate studies, Sharon has spent many early mornings and countless hours on the OVPR&rsquo;s Rapid Response Team and helping colleagues navigate the difficult process of losing federal funding, only to experience the same challenge herself,&quot;&nbsp;said College of Arts &amp; Sciences Dean Jennifer Malat. &quot;I am happy that the <span>Norwegian</span>&nbsp;Fulbright Commission&nbsp;will make it possible for her work to continue, and I wish that more researchers whose funding was cut would find that a new funder had stepped in. The College is proud of Sharon&rsquo;s contributions to understanding how nonviolent movements function and succeed.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p>

Robert Martin, president of the institute, gave Senior Producer Lou Divizio his perspective on the school&#39;s importance to indigenous culture and its uncertain future.</p>

<p>New Mexicans have celebrated Juneteenth for decades &ndash; long before it became a state holiday in 2006 and a federal holiday in 2021. The state&#39;s Black Chamber of Commerce hopes this year&#39;s Juneteenth event will be the biggest celebration yet. Host Nash Jones spoke with chamber president Karla Causey and chief administrative officer Beverly Gaines to learn what this year&#39;s celebration will look like</p>

<p>In March, the New Mexico Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission named Dannelle Kirven as its new executive director. This week, Kirven stopped by the studio for a conversation with Lou about her group&#39;s work in 2025, at a time when the federal government has explicitly targeted initiatives that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. Also, she tells us how the organization is moving past a 2018 financial scandal.</p>

<p>June is Pride Month and this past weekend, Albuquerque held its annual parade down Route 66. In a year that&#39;s seen a slew of executive orders targeting the trans community, and a month in which the federal government has declined to issue a pride month proclamation, people at this year&#39;s Albuquerque Pride acknowledged the fear and uncertainty many in the LGBTQ community are feeling. In this segment, produced by NMPBS Art and Cultural Affairs Executive Producer Michael Kamins, people there say pride is still all about celebration.</p>

<p>Plus, a quick preview of a conversation NMIF will air next week with Leon Howard, the new executive director of the ACLU of New Mexico. In his interview with Nash, Howard explains his priorities for the civil rights organization under his leadership.</p>

<p>NMiF airs on NMPBS 5.1&nbsp;(KNME HD) on Friday, June 13,&nbsp;at 7 p.m. and Sunday, June 15 at 7 a.m.&nbsp;and streaming on the PBS video app.&nbsp;​&nbsp;&nbsp;​</p>

<p>Recently <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.70284\" rel=\"\" target=\"\" title=\"\">published research</a> from a Ph.D. graduate from the biology department at The University of New Mexico finds that frequent fires have the potential to reduce tree water stress. Kevin Willson, a postdoctoral researcher with the Forest Service, found that fire-maintained forests had fewer trees with increasingly less water stress than fire-excluded forests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"textImage textImage-left\" style=\"float: left; width: 360px; margin: 10px 10px 10px; font-size: 90%; font-style: italic;\"><img align=\"left\" alt=\"IMG_5468 copy\" author=\"\" class=\"widget-image\" custom_size=\"false\" data-imgheight=\"270\" data-imgwidth=\"360\" file_id=\"684343ad3d6332577e48c817\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/175/files/20255/684343ad3d6332577e48c817_IMG_5468+copy/IMG_5468+copy_mid.png\" title=\"\" width=\"360\" /></div>

<p>&quot;Restoring frequent fire to these forests reduces forest density and competition for water, increasing the amount of water available per tree, which can improve tree response to drought,&quot; said Willson.&nbsp;&quot;As forests have become more flammable and prone to drought effects, determining how frequent fires affect tree response to drought is necessary to forecast how forests will function in response to future disturbances.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To assess tree response to drought following frequent-fire, Willson and his team compared tree growth and water stress before, during, and after two multi-year droughts (1996-2018) in fire maintained forests of the Gila Wilderness, where fires have been allowed to burn since 1975, and nearby areas that have not experienced a fire since at least 1909.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They found that frequent fires do not inhibit tree growth during drought but reduce&nbsp;forest density, which increases water availability for the remaining trees. Therefore, the reintroduction of frequent, low-severity fire regimes has the potential to moderate some effects of droughts on forests as climate change intensifies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This work demonstrates that there is value beyond just hazardous fuels reduction from restoring frequent fire in ponderosa pine forests. It demonstrates that regular fire can increase tree resilience to drought,&rdquo; said UNM biology professor Matthew Hurteau.</p>

<p><span>Rosa Vallejos-</span><span>Yop&aacute;n</span><span></span>, a linguistics professor at The University of New Mexico, has received the prestigious Fulbright Distinguished Scholar Award to further her research on Amazonian languages in Peru.&nbsp;This esteemed honor signifies Vallejos&#39; expertise in Amazonian languages and her research&rsquo;s impact on the communities she serves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was initially surprised to receive this award,&rdquo; said Vallejos. &ldquo;With the current federal funding cuts, I didn&rsquo;t think this would happen. I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful and excited to move my research forward.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Congress established the Fulbright Program in 1946 to promote awareness and foster friendly, peaceful partnerships with international communities and organizations; making collaboration a pillar of the program.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=\"https://fulbrightscholars.org/\">According to the Fulbright Scholar website</a>, the program awards over 400 grants in more than 135 countries to U.S. citizens for teaching, conducting research and working on professional projects worldwide.</p>

<p>Vallejos will partner with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.ufsc.br/\">Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC)</a>&nbsp;in Florian&oacute;polis, Brazil. She will study how bilingual individuals pay attention to their surroundings and how that influences their daily language and grammar usage, focusing on bilingual speakers in Secoya villages in the Peruvian Amazon, where Spanish is on the rise.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"textImage textImage-caption textImage-left\" style=\"float: left; width: 200px; margin: 10px 10px 10px; font-size: 90%; font-style: italic;\"><img align=\"left\" alt=\"Rosa working with Secoya language consultant\" author=\"\" class=\"widget-image\" custom_size=\"true\" data-imgheight=\"250\" data-imgwidth=\"200\" file_id=\"68432ad13d6332cf2b48ca04\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/175/files/20255/Rosa+working+with+Secoya+language+consultant.jpeg\" title=\"Rosa working with a Secoya language consultant\" width=\"200\" />

<p>Her fieldwork will take place in a remote region of the Amazon. She will fly first to Iquitos, a city surrounded by rivers. From Iquitos, she will travel by a small airplane to the Peru-Colombia border, and from there by boat along the Putumayo river to reach the Secoya villages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vallejos&rsquo; colleague Naomi Shin, a professor within UNM&rsquo;s linguistics department and the Spanish and Portuguese department, explained, &ldquo;Dr. Vallejos-Yop&aacute;n&#39;s research demonstrates how linguistic structure reflects humans&#39; conceptualizations of the world around them. What we pay most attention to and how we view the world is what gets encoded in our languages,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This groundbreaking research has implications for all situations of language contact.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The award encompasses four months of research in Brazil. She will utilize a flexible travel model to conduct her research. Her first trip is scheduled for Oct.&nbsp;&nbsp;and Nov.&nbsp;&nbsp;of this year, followed by another two months in early spring 2026; March and April.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While in Florianopolis, she will collaborate with her colleagues at UFSC by teaching two mini-courses for their graduate students in her areas of expertise and giving research presentations. Additionally, she will analyze the data she gathered in the field and work on disseminating the results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She hopes to aid her Brazilian colleagues in training native speakers, develop teaching materials for the Amazonian languages they research and assist in creating best practices on Indigenous language research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Rosa Vallejos-Yop&aacute;n is an extraordinary scholar whose work helps explain the nature of linguistic structure. Her research has led to many impactful research products, from books and articles to archival collections most important for language resources for local school and teachers in the communities she work with. Her tireless and unwavering commitment is inspiring,&rdquo; said Shin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vallejos has been studying Amazonian languages for 27 years and &ldquo;is deeply committed&rdquo; to positively impacting the communities she works with, and with this award she hopes to foster collaborations that will outlast her time in Brazil.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The University of New Mexico Physics and Astronomy department faculty are leading student interns through a 10-week program designed to introduce them to the academic research process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The annual Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program pays for most student expenses -- travel (up to $600), on-campus housing, a $6,000 stipend, the cost of most activities -- and focuses on the development of strong student-mentor relationships as well as laboratory and research skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are about 15 participating faculty members who essentially take on a student intern for the summer,&rdquo; said James Thomas, principal investigator for the department&rsquo;s REU program. &ldquo;It provides opportunities for students to do cutting edge research in physics or astronomy to get their feet wet.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"textImage textImage-right\" style=\"float: right; width: 360px; margin: 10px 10px 10px; font-size: 90%; font-style: italic;\"><img align=\"right\" alt=\"20241017_133035\" author=\"\" class=\"widget-image\" custom_size=\"false\" data-imgheight=\"480\" data-imgwidth=\"360\" file_id=\"6849ba233d633267e5d5b372\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/175/files/20255/6849ba233d633267e5d5b372_20241017_133035/20241017_133035_mid.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"360\" /></div>

<p>There are typically 8 students selected every year from across the country to participate. There is no requirement that students have any prior research experience; in fact, one of the goals of the project is to provide research opportunities for students who otherwise might not have them, according to Prof. Thomas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I think the impact of the program goes beyond the students who participate. We had nearly 300 applications for eight spots this spring and all those students who applied to our program are now aware that UNM has an NSF-funded undergraduate research program,&rdquo; Thomas said. &ldquo;When they think about that, when they think about going to graduate school, I think that that&#39;s in the back of their mind saying, you know, UNM is a player.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thomas said this program is perfect for students who don&rsquo;t know what they want to pursue in college. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a special opportunity for students to gain research experience working with world class researchers in physics and astronomy,&rdquo; Thomas said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Diana Dragomir Ph.D., assistant professor in the physics and astronomy department, said they do a lot of data analysis. &ldquo;It will be a lot of programming to manipulate, plot and interpret data. Students working with other faculty may spend most of their time in a lab running experiments or building instruments. It&rsquo;s uncommon, but there can be some field work with some faculty,&rdquo; Dragomir said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dragomir also said one of the students she supervised through this program is now a graduate student working alongside her, and another is now an engineer at Boeing. &ldquo;The student said, unprompted, that summer was one of the best experiences of her life,&rdquo; Dragomir said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>UNM Solar Splash is one of the senior design capstone project options for Mechanical Engineering students, with students from other engineering majors often participating to assist with the boat&rsquo;s electrical systems. Students spend the academic year leading up to the competition designing and constructing a solar-powered boat. Participants include universities from around the U.S. and abroad. The team&#39;s technical reports and videos are also scored prior to several sprint, slalom, and endurance races.</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"280\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/leS8d2C78Ok\" width=\"480\"></iframe></p>

<p>In addition to placing first overall, the UNM team was recognized with the Outstanding Electrical System Design Award. The students also placed second in the solar endurance and slalom races, and third in the sprint race and Outstanding Technical Report category.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was the best boat the UNM students brought to the competition since our university began participating in Solar Splash almost a decade ago,&rdquo; Peter Vorobieff, faculty advisor for the UNM team, said. &ldquo;Solar Splash provides the students with a realistic experience of what an entire path from a concept to a working product looks like in modern engineering, including some less glamorous aspects like fundraising or dealing with supply-chain issues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This year, students named their boat &ldquo;Unaltered Carbon&rdquo; as a nod to the carbon fiber used to construct it and a play on the title of Richard Morgan&rsquo;s science fiction novel &ldquo;Altered Carbon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Students on the UNM competition team include Kristina Ji, Silas Murphy, Jesus Martinez, Isaiah Deane and David Sabol.</p>

<p>The sponsors of this year&rsquo;s competition were the UNM School of Engineering, mechanical engineering alumnus Roger Koerner, David Menicucci, Sandia National Laboratories, DHX Electric Machines&nbsp;and SendCutSend.</p>

</div>

<p>Cha spoke about her new book, <em>A Just Transition for All: Workers and Communities for a Carbon-Free Future.&nbsp;</em>The talk was attended by a diverse audience of community organizers, University of New Mexico faculty, staff, students&nbsp;and members of the public.</p>

<p>Cha, a seasoned climate policy researcher who also works with advocacy organizations and unions, discussed the life cycle of extractive energy production and the resulting economic hardships to communities when the local source is depleted, referencing the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, the nation&rsquo;s large coal-producing area. Currently,&nbsp;Wyoming relies on coal mining for nearly half the state budget; the depleted supply negatively impacts both local and state economies.</p>

<p>Cha advocated planning for energy transition as fossil fuel use declines and creating long-term funding streams to support impacted workers and communities displaced by fossil fuel plant closures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Cha is one of the academics who has pioneered thinking about how to ensure that the transition to a low-carbon economy benefits all communities, especially fossil fuel worker communities,&rdquo; said College of Population Health Assistant Professor and co-convener Shannon Sanchez-Youngman.</p>

<p>The Grand Challenge Just Transition team also envisions an inclusive system for energy transition, according to Gabriel Pacyniak, Professor at the Law School and team co-convener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;New Mexico is well-positioned to be a leader in the low-carbon economy, but we are also very dependent on the fossil fuel industry &ndash; we are the second-largest producer of oil in the United States &ndash; and we have a high proportion of low-income people,&quot;&nbsp;Pacyniak said.&nbsp;&quot;We will need to collectively develop and implement effective policies that support fossil-fuel dependent communities in attracting new industries and jobs, and making them accessible to all New Mexicans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 2019 New Mexico Energy Transition Act (ETA) directs the state to move away from coal and toward clean energy and provides support for communities through the Energy Transition Economic Development Assistance Fund and Displaced Workers Assistance Fund. The Just Transition team is currently analyzing ETA supports provided to displaced coal power plant workers after the closing of the San Juan Generating Station in northwestern New Mexico. They&rsquo;ll also be working with the state to support and evaluate new workforce development programs for oil and gas workers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re grateful for the support from UNM&rsquo;s Grand Challenges program &ndash; we&rsquo;ve been able to use that support to bring in speakers like Dr. Cha,&rdquo; said Melanie Sonntag, research assistant professor at the Center for Social Policy and team program coordinator &ldquo;Not only has this support allowed us to learn from these speakers &ndash; it has helped us connect with nationally-prominent scholars and policymakers working on these issues.&quot;<br />

<br />
The Grand Challenges program was launched in late 2018 by UNM President Garnett Stokes. Grand Challenges are problems of global, national, and regional significance that require researchers to work together across disciplinary boundaries to develop and implement solutions. Grand Challenges address problems that, when solved, have a significant positive impact on people and society. The University of New Mexico is the state&rsquo;s leading research institution, making it the ideal location in which to situate complex interdisciplinary research work.<br />

A UNM distinguished alumna, Schadl brings a wealth of experience in archives and library leadership to her new role. She will begin her tenure as director and full professor Aug. 1.</p>

<p>Schadl has spent the past seven years serving as chief of the Latin American, Caribbean, and European Division at the Library of Congress. In this role, she has led expansive efforts to develop and share library collections representing 83 countries and over 60 languages. As a senior leader within the General and International Collections division, she has also contributed to shaping the vision and strategy of the Library of Congress, the world&rsquo;s largest library and the nation&rsquo;s oldest federal cultural heritage institution.</p>

<p>Before her work at the Library of Congress, she served as the curator of Latin American Collections at UNM from 2008 to 2018. Before that, she served as the director of the Gerald and Betty Ford Library at the Bosque School from 2004 to 2008, as an assistant professor of history at Roanoke College from 2002 to 2004, and as&nbsp;a lecturer in history at the University of Texas at Austin in 1999.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am excited to work with the outstanding staff and faculty at the Center for Southwest Research and Special Collections, as well as with communities at UNM and across the Greater Southwest,&quot;&nbsp;Schadl said, reflecting on her return. &quot;Together, we will engage the Special Collections with emerging and established scholarship, creativity, and problem-solving while centering ongoing research and creative work from and about the Greater Southwest. I believe the CSWR can be a vibrant hub for transformative community-engaged learning, teaching, and responsible stewardship aimed at ensuring greater accountability in the historical record, increased justice in archival representation, and active learning across communities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Schadl holds a doctorate in Latin American Studies from the University of New Mexico and earned her bachelor of arts in International Studies and Spanish from The Ohio State University.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Suzanne Schadl back to UNM,&rdquo; said Leo Lo, dean of the College of University Libraries and Learning Sciences. &ldquo;Her deep expertise in archives, international collections and library leadership, along with her visionary approach to engaging communities, will greatly strengthen CSWR&rsquo;s role as a hub for scholarship, learning and cultural stewardship. Suzanne&rsquo;s appointment marks an exciting new chapter for both our libraries and the wider UNM community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.unm.edu/cswr/index.php\">Center for Southwest Research and Special Collections</a>&nbsp;at the University of New Mexico is dedicated to preserving and providing access to the historical and cultural records of the Southwest and Latin America.

A special place&nbsp;inside <span>PA&Iacute;S&nbsp;</span>with all types of&nbsp;tools and machines to build things that can&rsquo;t exactly be purchased at the store.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all to support research within their department and all areas across campus, such as the College of Engineering (COE), Center for High Tech Materials (CHTM), Chemistry and Biology, along with&nbsp;various departments in the Health Sciences Center (HSC).</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of different research projects on campus that need custom fixtures made, support, infrastructure for experiments happening, so anywhere on campus, we&rsquo;re available for that,&rdquo; said Anthony Gravagne, the senior&nbsp;<!--StartFragment--><span data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\">machinist&nbsp;</span>at the <a href=\"https://physics.unm.edu/\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Department of Physics and Astronomy</a> Machine Shop.</p>

<p>He believes the shop has been operational since the 1950s for the same purpose: to aid in research. Gravagne said the shop assisted with satellite infrastructure in the 1960s and supported the on-campus observatory. While machine shops are not&nbsp;unique&nbsp;to universities, UNM&#39;s Physics and Astronomy machine shop is distinct because it contributes to broader research, working for other departments across campus, as well as for several outside entities, including nonprofits, national labs, and the New Mexico Museum of Natural History &amp; Science.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are several notable designs the machine shop has created, such as making and maintaining the&nbsp;large physics demos in&nbsp;PA&Iacute;S&nbsp;<!--StartFragment--><span data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\">and Regener lecture halls,</span>&nbsp;and previously&nbsp;<span>fabricating some support frames for dark matter research. </span></p>

<p><span>&quot;These were large acrylic frames that we had to make, detectors&nbsp;that went deep underground into mines,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t always know all the science behind the stuff we make,&nbsp;I get the drawings and sketches and they say make this.&quot;</span></p>

<p>Generally, research faculty and graduate students utilize the services in the machine shop. A&nbsp;student shop&nbsp;is also built into the area, where trained graduate and undergraduate students can use the equipment.&nbsp;Nearly seven years ago, the shop moved to its current location in PA&Iacute;S&nbsp;from UNM&#39;s north campus at Lomas and Yale, where the new critical care tower now stands.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"textImage textImage-center\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; width: 400px; font-size: 90%; font-style: italic;\"><img align=\"center\" alt=\"as-pa\" author=\"\" class=\"widget-image\" custom_size=\"true\" data-imgheight=\"225\" data-imgwidth=\"400\" file_id=\"6837875a3d63324c5073d724\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/175/files/20254/as-pa.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" /></div>

<p>After 20 years at the machine shop, Gravagne expresses great pride in his work and&nbsp;supporting research missions across various fields.</p>

<p>&quot;A lot of the research we have been involved in has been beneficial for medicine, X-ray technology, and general physics advancements over the years, so I&nbsp;take pride in knowing that I was able to help with that in some small way,&quot; he said. &quot;It&rsquo;s not so much just coming into work and making the same thing over and over again. It&rsquo;s a chance for me to assist in the research mission for the university at large and&nbsp;build my skill set doing it, in a way that&rsquo;s beneficial to&nbsp;the state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shop will cost you $25&nbsp;an hour.&nbsp;There are several other machine shops across UNM&#39;s campus, such as&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://engineering.unm.edu/research/facilities.html\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">College of Engineering&#39;s&nbsp;Mechanical Engineering Machine Shop</a>&nbsp;and facilities in CHTM on the south campus.&nbsp;</p>

New research led by a University of New Mexico School of Engineering faculty member says yes.</p>

<p>Protected bike lanes are associated with nearly double the number of bike ridership than standard bike lanes, according to a new paper published in Nature Cities.</p>

<p>The paper, titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44284-025-00255-5\">The link between low-stress bicycle facilities and bicycle commuting,&rdquo;</a> reports that protected bike lanes see about 1.8 times the number of bike commuters than standard bike lanes do and 4.3 times as many as blocks without bike lanes.</p>

<p>UNM&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://civil.unm.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-profiles/nicholas-n.-ferenchak.html\">Nick Ferenchak</a>, associate professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering and director of the Center for Pedestrian and Bicyclist Safety, led the research. <a href=\"https://architectureandplanning.ucdenver.edu/our-people/person-profile/Marshall-Wesley-UCD22363\">Wesley Marshall</a>, professor of civil engineering at the University of Colorado at Denver, co-authored the paper.</p>

<p>The researchers examined six years of longitudinal data across 14,011 blocks in 28 U.S. cities to make the determination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cities that seek to boost bicycle commute mode shifts should focus on implementing low-stress bicycle facilities if they want to best facilitate the sizable population of less-confident potential riders,&rdquo; Ferenchak said.</p>

<p>According to Ferenchak, the results can be interpreted as validation of the stress-based planning tool known as Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress. Civil engineers use tools like this to help determine what street infrastructure is suitable for bicyclists of different ages and experience levels. The less stressful an area is to bike ride in, the more people will utilize it.</p>

<p>To compare the different types of bicycle facilities, or lane styles, Ferenchak and Marshall first looked at cities with more than double the national average of bicycle commute mode share using the American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Fourteen cities with high levels of bicycle commuting were paired with cities of similar population size, geographic area, climate and function that have substantially lower levels of bicycle commuters. In order to complete the analysis, they used historic bicycle maps, interviewed city employees, and examined historic images from Google Earth and Google Street View. Then, they classified groups of street blocks by type of bicycle infrastructure and mileage of each type.</p>

<p>Researchers found that while standard bike lanes increase the number of bicycle commuters compared to streets with no bike infrastructure, protected bike lanes and buffered bike lanes encourage even greater numbers of bicycle commuters. While a greater number of bicycle commuters may not be a city&rsquo;s primary end goal, it could help lower fuel consumption, emissions, and transportation costs while producing better health outcomes and greater safety for bicyclists.</p>

<p>Ferenchak leads the <a href=\"https://www.pedbikesafety.org/\">Center for Pedestrian and Bicyclist Safety</a>, a Tier-1 University Transportation Center funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The center&rsquo;s goal is to eliminate pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities and serious injuries through research, education, technology transfer and workforce development.</p>

This important digital archive provides public access to previously sealed legal documents related to clergy sexual abuse cases in New Mexico.</p>

<p>The collection was established as a part of the settlement between the Archdiocese of Santa Fe and victims of sexual abuse perpetrated by its clergy members. This first batch of documents consists of deposition transcripts related to lawsuits against the Archdiocese in the 1900s, 2000s, and 2010s. Overall the collection includes depositions, personnel files, church administrative records, and other legal documents from the settlement. These documents, now available in digital format, serve as a crucial resource for survivors, researchers, journalists, and community members seeking greater transparency and accountability in institutional abuse cases.</p>

<p>&quot;New Mexico was an epicenter of Catholic sexual abuse in the US; the state gained the reputation of a &ldquo;dumping ground&rdquo; because priests who abused young people landed frequently here. But in a remarkable development, the Archdiocese of Santa Fe handed over its &ldquo;abuse files&rdquo; to UNM as part of its bankruptcy settlement. Now UNM is the first university in the US to hold a Catholic sexual abuse archive,&rdquo; said Kathleen Holscher, associate professor of Religious Studies and American Studies. Holscher also holds the endowed chair of the Roman Catholic Studies at UNM. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Archdiocese of Santa Fe Institutional Abuse Collection is one of the largest publicly accessible collections of clerical abuse documents anywhere, and one of the largest collections related to Catholicism in the U.S. Southwest outside the Church&rsquo;s own holdings. In addition to being a critical resource for survivors and the public, the UNM abuse archive is an extraordinary opportunity for scholars interested in religion and abuse, as well as Catholicism in New Mexico and the U.S. Southwest,&quot; added&nbsp;Holscher.</p>

<p>This release represents the initial segment of a larger digitization effort. The CSWR staff working on this collection consists of Portia Vescio, university archivist, and Avi Woontner, library information specialist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Working with the collection has been a huge challenge for us in a number of ways. We had to set up a whole new technical infrastructure to work with the files. Then there was the subject matter. Some of the files are very tough to read,&quot;&nbsp;said Vescio.&nbsp;&quot;We have recognized that working with these files means that we have to pay attention not only to the work getting done, but also to the mental health of the person doing the work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the first collection of its kind here at UNM. Early on, we discussed different ways to make the collection available and ultimately decided that we would put the materials online for people to access.&nbsp;It seems fairer to all&nbsp;researchers since we know people from different parts of the country&nbsp;and even in different parts of the world&nbsp;want to see what is in these files. We also knew that since staff had gotten emotional looking at the files, that perhaps the researchers would like to be in the privacy of their homes when they access the files.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vescio and Woontner continue to prepare the remaining documents for public access. As Vescio mentions, the collection will be completely available online. CSWR plans to release more materials through intermittent updates over the next month, depending on the process of this first batch. The CSWR is dedicated to preserving historical records and believe that access to this documentation is essential in acknowledging past harms and supporting continued healing and justice.</p>

<p>Held at Tamaya Resort in Bernalillo, the conference included more than 520 economists from around the world. The conference helps facilitate networking and collaboration opportunities, enabling researchers to connect with peers and mentors, forge collaborations, and build long-term relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=\"https://www.aere.org/\">AERE</a> was founded in 1979 as a means for exchanging ideas, stimulating research, and promoting graduate training in environmental and resource economics, and is geared toward mentorship and professional development programs, particularly for graduate students and young scholars while helping to provide support for their career growth. AERE currently has over 1,000 members from more than 30 nations, coming from academic institutions, the public sector, and private industry.</p>

<p>The University of New Mexico <a href=\"https://econ.unm.edu/\">Department of Economics</a> played a key role in the planning of the conference and had a strong contingent of more than 25 with UNM connections participating. This group included research professors as well as current and former students who have gone on to positions at other universities and organizations, and several who have been connected to the department for more than 30 years including Professor Emerita <a href=\"https://econ.unm.edu/people/faculty/profile/janie-chermak.html\">Janie Chermak</a> and Regent&rsquo;s Professor <a href=\"https://econ.unm.edu/people/faculty/profile/robert-berrens.html\">Bob Berrens</a>.</p>

<p>Environmental and resource economics has garnered more attention over the decades, but it didn&rsquo;t start out that way. Originally, economists interested in environmental issues started out as agricultural, land, mineral and or forest economists. As environmental issues became bigger topics in the 1970s and 80s, the name of environmental economics emerged out of that.</p>

<p>UNM Economics Department, though small in size, has played an important role, with pioneers in the field who called UNM home. Their influence continues today in the faculty&rsquo;s research, which tackles critical New Mexican, Southwest, and world challenges&mdash;water, wildfire, energy transitions, environmental health, and climate impacts&mdash; through cutting-edge, interdisciplinary methods.</p>

<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">&ndash; Regent&#39;s&nbsp;Professor&nbsp;Bob Berrens</span></span></strong></em><span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite its size, UNM had a strong group at the conference. It was through UNM&rsquo;s group and Chermak&#39;s efforts, along with support from UNM and the <a href=\"https://artsci.unm.edu/\">College of Arts and Sciences</a>, to be able to secure the AERE 2025 Summer Conference here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see the size of this national organization and there&#39;s also a world organization. I&#39;m stunned at the size of the conference,&rdquo; said Berrens. &ldquo;If you would&#39;ve attended one of these 30 years ago, there was only just at that time sort of a fledgling field in environmental and resource economics. However, the University of New Mexico already had a foothold. Despite being a relatively small program, it has been able to sustain that through time. It&#39;s not something I created, but just been a part of. I&#39;m very proud to have been part of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&#39;s what has made the UNM Department of Economics fairly unique to create an environmental resource program in a small department says Berrens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Ph.D. was in agriculture and resource economics. Janie&#39;s was in mineral economics. But I think both of us knew at grad school we would go and work on environmental resource issues. So, I was trained as an agricultural economist and she was trained as a mineral economist, and that was common for people 30 to 35 years ago.&rdquo; Distinguished Professor Emeritus David Brookshire and Professor Emeritus H. Stuart Burness, both early environmental and resource economists themselves, played a role in hiring Berrens and Chermak in the early 1990s.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s conference brought together experts from different sectors including academia, government, and the private sectors, to discuss policy implications and practical applications of environmental and resource economics, informing decision-making.&nbsp;It covered a broad range of topics, including energy, climate change, pollution, minerals, endangered species, water resources, natural resource management, and more, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Research presented ranged from Resilient Energy Economies, Understanding the Macroeconomic Implications of Large-Scale Climate Change Risk, Climate Change &ndash; Modeling, Environmental Health, Agriculture - Developing Countries, Urban Water Pricing and Climate Change &ndash; Policy to name a few. Urban Water Pricing featured research from UNM Ph.D. candidate Nahid Samimi titled <em>Quantifying Heterogeneity in the Price Elasticities of Urban Water Demand: The Case of a Metropolitan Area in the US Southwest</em>. Her mentor is UNM Associate Professor <a href=\"https://econ.unm.edu/people/faculty/profile/jingjing-wang.html\">Jingjing Wang</a>, who is also the Associate Director of UNM&rsquo;s interdisciplinary graduate Water Resources Program.</p>

<p>Reflecting the breadth of topics, Assistant Professor Yuting Yang presented her research titled <em>Optimal Solar Capacity Investment under Varying Net Metering Structures</em>, while Assistant Professor <em>Xiaoyang Wang presented his research titled When is Nickel Worth a Quarter:The Impact of the 2022 LME Nickel Short Squeeze</em>.</p>

<p>Another UNM graduate student participant was Ahmed Amine Jawhari, who presented&nbsp; <em>Willingness-to-Pay for Less Wildfire Smoke? Unpacking Uncertainty, Consequentiality, and Prescribed Burning Acceptance in the Western US</em>. Jawhari&rsquo;s research discussed whether or not citizens were willing to accept less wildfire smoke from prescribed burns rather than much more smoke from a full blown wildfire. UNM Associate Professor and Regent&rsquo;s Lecturer <a href=\"https://econ.unm.edu/people/faculty/profile/benjamin-jones.html\">Benjamin Jones</a> and Berrens are his mentors.</p>

<p>Along the lines of wildfire, a plenary session titled The Changing Risk and Burden of Wildfire, garnered significant interest on the opening day of the conference. It highlighted wildfire risk and how it is rapidly changing in the U.S. and many other countries. The session provided tools and insights from economics, in combination with data and models from the natural sciences, remote sensing, and machine learning. This combination is proving critical in understanding this changing risk and how we might respond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing that I would emphasize is the group that we have, because it&#39;s important to have critical mass. If you&#39;re one person exploring environmental and resource issues by yourself, it&#39;s hard to make headway,&rdquo; said Berrens. &ldquo;But if you can have five or six faculty members working on a related set of broader issues, then over time and as a community with that critical mass, that&#39;s how you make impact and how there&#39;s growth and those ideas and skill sets grow from the collaboration in the community and the group. And that happens both in place and across place.</p>

<p>&quot;What we&rsquo;re watching at the conference is that network come together and being hosted here at New Mexico, which is great, but the most important thing is to have that critical mass and community inside a department.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mission of the Strategic Data Project is to transform the use of data in education to improve student achievement. The project seeks to facilitate better access to appropriately analyzed data, which allows academic leaders to better diagnose issues, develop solutions, and monitor the results of implementing these solutions, emphasizing data governance and accessibility.</p>

<p>The 18-month fellowship kicks off at the end of July, when Orozco and Villalobos Melendez will travel to Cambridge, Mass., for the Strategic Data Project Minority Serving Institution Orientation. There, they will have the chance to interact with the representatives from the other institutions in the program.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This should align well with the work we are already aiming to do at UNM to improve our data governance and data accessibility framework,&rdquo; Orozco said.</p>

<p>The orientation and subsequent gatherings and activities are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>

</div>

<p>Orozco became OIA director in January. OIA, based in the Office of Academic Affairs, is the official source for reported metrics and aggregated data at UNM. OIA generates reports and datasets for a variety of uses, including federal compliance reporting, state reporting, and internal recordkeeping and analytics. &nbsp;It also generates and maintains the Official Student Enrollment Reports, as well as aggregated Factbook information on faculty, staff and UNM&rsquo;s four branch campuses.</p>

<p>With the SDP MSI fellowship, Orozco is looking forward to learning from peer institutions to improve data access transparency at UNM. She is also eager to connect with other campuses on data literacy programming, and developing data communities at institutions of higher education.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This fellowship will provide us with a multi-institutional framework where we can learn best practices from other universities &mdash; both what has worked for them and what hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Orozco said that she will take insights she gains from the fellowship and use that knowledge to improve UNM&rsquo;s data presentation and access, which is part of an ongoing effort that includes revamping some of the dashboards and implementing increased education and awareness on how the campus community can better locate and utilize the data the University collects.</p>

<p>Villalobos Melendez will represent UNM-Taos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am honored and very excited to have been selected as a Strategic Data Project (SDP) Fellow at the Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University,&rdquo; said Villalobos Melendez. &ldquo;This fellowship connects me to a dynamic network of data professionals dedicated to enhancing the effective use of data in higher education.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looks forward to deepening her analytical skills and adopting innovative data strategies that enhance student success and support the institutional goals at UNM-Taos, particularly as they apply to the Native population in northern New Mexico.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fellowship project will focus specifically on a comprehensive analysis of our institutional data related to Indigenous students,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;By examining critical factors such as enrollment patterns, program success rates, and retention, this work aims to guide meaningful actions and strengthen our student support systems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ultimately, Villalobos Melendez believes the insights and tools she gains through this experience will enhance the data-informed culture on campus. But, most importantly, she is &ldquo;eager to bring back fresh, impactful strategies and approaches that directly benefit our students and community.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\">&ldquo;If you think about the role of school psychologists, they are very important, increasingly more since COVID,&quot; she said.&nbsp;&ldquo;In the article, I talk about how the law currently supports psychologists&rsquo; role and how they could further support the safety of children in schools, broadly defined.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span>She defines safety broadly because the relatively infrequent instances of mass violence are overshadowed by much more frequent student safety concerns.</span></p>

<p>Research shows the policing &#39;safety&#39;&nbsp;measures have a high cost (physical, emotional, educational, constitutional), often outweighing the benefits, especially for black and brown children or children with disabilities. While some argue to remove police from&nbsp;schools completely,&nbsp;Ahranjani takes a middle ground approach,&nbsp;scaling back the presence of police and restrictive policing measures, and instead giving psychologists, who are better trained in mental health,&nbsp;a more vital platform to intervene. According to her research, psychologists help students build resilience, connect with resources, and contribute to a child&#39;s daily needs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Psychologists address real daily safety needs that children have &ndash; food insecurity, housing instability, health issues affecting their learning &ndash; those things&nbsp;are threats to their safety more so daily than anything else,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>The article also examines the connection between the school-to-prison pipeline and the role that officers may play in it. According to Ahranjani, evidence indicates that contact with officers early in life can lead to later criminal behavior. &quot;<span>Black and Brown children, kids with disabilities, children in foster care, are much more likely to have contact with school police officers and to be disciplined, and that&rsquo;s a real problem,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00;\">&quot;School psychologists occupy a unique position in terms of potentially interrupting the harm caused by school policing for several reasons. First, they provide front-line support to students, so they know better than other school actors how policing and &ldquo;safety&rdquo; measures affect children&rsquo;s sense of physical and emotional safety at school. Second, their special professional training and experience sensitizes them to see the signs of harm and facilitates their ability to resolve conflicts. Third, their positionality within public school systems as highly skilled, well-paid, and respected professionals may mean that their concerns carry more weight than other stakeholders. Fourth, school psychologists&rsquo; ethical obligations under The Professional Standards of the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) mandate that they stand up for students and school communities. Finally, most states and the District of Columbia have&nbsp;passed legislation around school safety that either explicitly invites school psychologists to be partners or provides entry points for them to facilitate training, collaborate with school resource officers (SROs) in addressing safety concerns, and sound the warning bell when they have concerns about how students are treated by SROs and other adults.&quot;</span></em></p>

<p><span data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\">This&nbsp;research is&nbsp;significant&nbsp;to Ahranjani, who experienced a mass shooting at her own&nbsp;elementary school&nbsp;</span><span>nearly&nbsp;</span><span>40 years ago&nbsp;in her&nbsp;Chicago suburb&nbsp;when she was 11 years old and in middle school. The groundwork&nbsp;</span><span>for this particular article</span><span>&nbsp;started taking form in&nbsp;early 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. Ahranjani and others formed a group to examine the role of school resource officers. This initiative attracted local media attention and caught the interest of Dr. Lisa Peterson, a school psychologist and director of the School Psychology Program at New Mexico State University. This collaboration led to Ahranjani speaking at conferences and connecting with professionals in the field, ultimately resulting in the creation of this article.</span></p>

<p><span data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\">The bottom line: Fewer SROs and more school psychologists.&nbsp;Ahranjani hopes to expand on&nbsp;this research&nbsp;by writing a book on school policing in the future. &quot;I hope everyone, including those who believe police are essential in schools, will approach&nbsp;</span><span>these</span><span>&nbsp;ideas with an open mind because&nbsp;the research is clear,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</span></p>

Sharon Erickson Nepstad, a distinguished professor in the <a href=\"https://sociology.unm.edu/\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Department of Sociology &amp; Criminology</a> at The University of New Mexico, is heading overseas next spring for research after&nbsp;being awarded a prestigious grant&nbsp;at the <a href=\"https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/about-us/nobel-institute/\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Norwegian Nobel Institute</a> in Oslo, Norway. &nbsp;</p>

<p>While she originally applied for a&nbsp;Fulbright Scholar Fellowship Program in September 2024 at Norway&#39;s Nobel Institute for Advanced International Studies and&nbsp;was&nbsp;later approved by several expert panels and the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board, the U.S. State Department terminated the fellowship for allegedly violating one of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s executive orders. However, the Norwegian office and the European Fulbright Commissions offered her and other recipients a &lsquo;Plan B&rsquo; scholarship, a <em>U.S.-Norwegian Fulbright Foundation&nbsp;grant</em>, which will allow Nepstad to do research at the Nobel Institute in the spring of 2026.</p>

<p>&quot;While I was deeply disappointed that my fellowship had been terminated, I am thrilled to be able to do my research, nonetheless. I&rsquo;m elated that Fulbright Norway is choosing to resist this violation of academic freedom and support us so we can continue our work,&quot; Nepstad said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nepstad&#39;s research area is in peace studies and social movements. While in Norway, she will work on her new project&nbsp;titled:&nbsp;<em>The Price of Peace: Relinquishing the Social Benefits of Enemies,&nbsp;</em>and in the archives at the Nobel Institute, the organization that grants the Nobel Peace Prize.<em>&nbsp;&quot;</em><span>I am working on a book that explores the allure of enemy dynamics and the social benefits that groups derive from being in conflict. To successfully move past a conflict and establish peace, groups have to relinquish these enemy dynamics,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Nepstad will be conducting case studies to explore:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>How do groups resist the pull to perpetuate enemy dynamics during a conflict?</li>
	<li>How do groups dismantle enemy dynamics in the aftermath of a conflict to make sustainable peace possible?</li>
	<li>What challenges or obstacles do they face in transforming enmity?</li>
	<li>How do groups substitute the social benefits that enemies previously provided?</li>
</ul>

<p>The 100,000&nbsp;Norwegian Kroner ($10,000) grant will provide&nbsp;funding to cover Nepstad&#39;s&nbsp;airfare and living expenses while staying in Oslo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;I chose my academic path when I was living in West Germany and working for an international peace organization. During that time, the Berlin Wall fell&nbsp;to everyone&rsquo;s astonishment. I decided that I wanted to attend graduate school to study how people living in authoritarian conditions could nonviolently transform their political systems. That is what I&rsquo;ve been doing since I finished my Ph.D. in 1996,&quot; said Nepstad.&nbsp;&quot;To study at the Nobel Institute is an honor and the culmination of my career goal of contributing to a deeper understanding of nonviolent social movements. In addition, as the granddaughter of a Norwegian immigrant, I&rsquo;m grateful for the opportunity to learn more about my own cultural heritage.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nepstad, who also serves as the associate dean for Reserach and Graduate Studies in the <a href=\"https://artsci.unm.edu/\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">College of Arts &amp;&nbsp;Sciences</a>, has published seven&nbsp;books and dozens of articles.&nbsp;<span>She&#39;s been with UNM since 2009 after holding faculty positions at several other universities.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-teams=\"true\">&quot;As interim associate dean for research&nbsp;and graduate studies, Sharon has spent many early mornings and countless hours on the OVPR&rsquo;s Rapid Response Team and helping colleagues navigate the difficult process of losing federal funding, only to experience the same challenge herself,&quot;&nbsp;said College of Arts &amp; Sciences Dean Jennifer Malat. &quot;I am happy that the <span>Norwegian</span>&nbsp;Fulbright Commission&nbsp;will make it possible for her work to continue, and I wish that more researchers whose funding was cut would find that a new funder had stepped in. The College is proud of Sharon&rsquo;s contributions to understanding how nonviolent movements function and succeed.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>New Mexicans have celebrated Juneteenth for decades &ndash; long before it became a state holiday in 2006 and a federal holiday in 2021. The state&#39;s Black Chamber of Commerce hopes this year&#39;s Juneteenth event will be the biggest celebration yet. Host Nash Jones spoke with chamber president Karla Causey and chief administrative officer Beverly Gaines to learn what this year&#39;s celebration will look like</p>

<p>In March, the New Mexico Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission named Dannelle Kirven as its new executive director. This week, Kirven stopped by the studio for a conversation with Lou about her group&#39;s work in 2025, at a time when the federal government has explicitly targeted initiatives that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. Also, she tells us how the organization is moving past a 2018 financial scandal.</p>

<p>June is Pride Month and this past weekend, Albuquerque held its annual parade down Route 66. In a year that&#39;s seen a slew of executive orders targeting the trans community, and a month in which the federal government has declined to issue a pride month proclamation, people at this year&#39;s Albuquerque Pride acknowledged the fear and uncertainty many in the LGBTQ community are feeling. In this segment, produced by NMPBS Art and Cultural Affairs Executive Producer Michael Kamins, people there say pride is still all about celebration.</p>

<p>Plus, a quick preview of a conversation NMIF will air next week with Leon Howard, the new executive director of the ACLU of New Mexico. In his interview with Nash, Howard explains his priorities for the civil rights organization under his leadership.</p>

<p>NMiF airs on NMPBS 5.1&nbsp;(KNME HD) on Friday, June 13,&nbsp;at 7 p.m. and Sunday, June 15 at 7 a.m.&nbsp;and streaming on the PBS video app.&nbsp;​&nbsp;&nbsp;​</p>

<p>Recently <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.70284\" rel=\"\" target=\"\" title=\"\">published research</a> from a Ph.D. graduate from the biology department at The University of New Mexico finds that frequent fires have the potential to reduce tree water stress. Kevin Willson, a postdoctoral researcher with the Forest Service, found that fire-maintained forests had fewer trees with increasingly less water stress than fire-excluded forests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"textImage textImage-left\" style=\"float: left; width: 360px; margin: 10px 10px 10px; font-size: 90%; font-style: italic;\"><img align=\"left\" alt=\"IMG_5468 copy\" author=\"\" class=\"widget-image\" custom_size=\"false\" data-imgheight=\"270\" data-imgwidth=\"360\" file_id=\"684343ad3d6332577e48c817\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/175/files/20255/684343ad3d6332577e48c817_IMG_5468+copy/IMG_5468+copy_mid.png\" title=\"\" width=\"360\" /></div>

<p>&quot;Restoring frequent fire to these forests reduces forest density and competition for water, increasing the amount of water available per tree, which can improve tree response to drought,&quot; said Willson.&nbsp;&quot;As forests have become more flammable and prone to drought effects, determining how frequent fires affect tree response to drought is necessary to forecast how forests will function in response to future disturbances.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To assess tree response to drought following frequent-fire, Willson and his team compared tree growth and water stress before, during, and after two multi-year droughts (1996-2018) in fire maintained forests of the Gila Wilderness, where fires have been allowed to burn since 1975, and nearby areas that have not experienced a fire since at least 1909.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They found that frequent fires do not inhibit tree growth during drought but reduce&nbsp;forest density, which increases water availability for the remaining trees. Therefore, the reintroduction of frequent, low-severity fire regimes has the potential to moderate some effects of droughts on forests as climate change intensifies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This work demonstrates that there is value beyond just hazardous fuels reduction from restoring frequent fire in ponderosa pine forests. It demonstrates that regular fire can increase tree resilience to drought,&rdquo; said UNM biology professor Matthew Hurteau.</p>

<p><span>Rosa Vallejos-</span><span>Yop&aacute;n</span><span></span>, a linguistics professor at The University of New Mexico, has received the prestigious Fulbright Distinguished Scholar Award to further her research on Amazonian languages in Peru.&nbsp;This esteemed honor signifies Vallejos&#39; expertise in Amazonian languages and her research&rsquo;s impact on the communities she serves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was initially surprised to receive this award,&rdquo; said Vallejos. &ldquo;With the current federal funding cuts, I didn&rsquo;t think this would happen. I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful and excited to move my research forward.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Congress established the Fulbright Program in 1946 to promote awareness and foster friendly, peaceful partnerships with international communities and organizations; making collaboration a pillar of the program.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=\"https://fulbrightscholars.org/\">According to the Fulbright Scholar website</a>, the program awards over 400 grants in more than 135 countries to U.S. citizens for teaching, conducting research and working on professional projects worldwide.</p>

<p>Vallejos will partner with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.ufsc.br/\">Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC)</a>&nbsp;in Florian&oacute;polis, Brazil. She will study how bilingual individuals pay attention to their surroundings and how that influences their daily language and grammar usage, focusing on bilingual speakers in Secoya villages in the Peruvian Amazon, where Spanish is on the rise.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"textImage textImage-caption textImage-left\" style=\"float: left; width: 200px; margin: 10px 10px 10px; font-size: 90%; font-style: italic;\"><img align=\"left\" alt=\"Rosa working with Secoya language consultant\" author=\"\" class=\"widget-image\" custom_size=\"true\" data-imgheight=\"250\" data-imgwidth=\"200\" file_id=\"68432ad13d6332cf2b48ca04\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/175/files/20255/Rosa+working+with+Secoya+language+consultant.jpeg\" title=\"Rosa working with a Secoya language consultant\" width=\"200\" />
<div class=\"textImage-captionBody\" style=\"padding: 3px 0px; clear: both;\">Rosa working with a Secoya language consultant</div>
</div>

<p>Her fieldwork will take place in a remote region of the Amazon. She will fly first to Iquitos, a city surrounded by rivers. From Iquitos, she will travel by a small airplane to the Peru-Colombia border, and from there by boat along the Putumayo river to reach the Secoya villages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vallejos&rsquo; colleague Naomi Shin, a professor within UNM&rsquo;s linguistics department and the Spanish and Portuguese department, explained, &ldquo;Dr. Vallejos-Yop&aacute;n&#39;s research demonstrates how linguistic structure reflects humans&#39; conceptualizations of the world around them. What we pay most attention to and how we view the world is what gets encoded in our languages,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This groundbreaking research has implications for all situations of language contact.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The award encompasses four months of research in Brazil. She will utilize a flexible travel model to conduct her research. Her first trip is scheduled for Oct.&nbsp;&nbsp;and Nov.&nbsp;&nbsp;of this year, followed by another two months in early spring 2026; March and April.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While in Florianopolis, she will collaborate with her colleagues at UFSC by teaching two mini-courses for their graduate students in her areas of expertise and giving research presentations. Additionally, she will analyze the data she gathered in the field and work on disseminating the results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She hopes to aid her Brazilian colleagues in training native speakers, develop teaching materials for the Amazonian languages they research and assist in creating best practices on Indigenous language research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Rosa Vallejos-Yop&aacute;n is an extraordinary scholar whose work helps explain the nature of linguistic structure. Her research has led to many impactful research products, from books and articles to archival collections most important for language resources for local school and teachers in the communities she work with.

<p>The University of New Mexico Physics and Astronomy department faculty are leading student interns through a 10-week program designed to introduce them to the academic research process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The annual Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program pays for most student expenses -- travel (up to $600), on-campus housing, a $6,000 stipend, the cost of most activities -- and focuses on the development of strong student-mentor relationships as well as laboratory and research skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are about 15 participating faculty members who essentially take on a student intern for the summer,&rdquo; said James Thomas, principal investigator for the department&rsquo;s REU program. &ldquo;It provides opportunities for students to do cutting edge research in physics or astronomy to get their feet wet.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"textImage textImage-right\" style=\"float: right; width: 360px; margin: 10px 10px 10px; font-size: 90%; font-style: italic;\"><img align=\"right\" alt=\"20241017_133035\" author=\"\" class=\"widget-image\" custom_size=\"false\" data-imgheight=\"480\" data-imgwidth=\"360\" file_id=\"6849ba233d633267e5d5b372\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/175/files/20255/6849ba233d633267e5d5b372_20241017_133035/20241017_133035_mid.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"360\" /></div>

<p>There are typically 8 students selected every year from across the country to participate. There is no requirement that students have any prior research experience; in fact, one of the goals of the project is to provide research opportunities for students who otherwise might not have them, according to Prof. Thomas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I think the impact of the program goes beyond the students who participate. We had nearly 300 applications for eight spots this spring and all those students who applied to our program are now aware that UNM has an NSF-funded undergraduate research program,&rdquo; Thomas said. &ldquo;When they think about that, when they think about going to graduate school, I think that that&#39;s in the back of their mind saying, you know, UNM is a player.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thomas said this program is perfect for students who don&rsquo;t know what they want to pursue in college. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a special opportunity for students to gain research experience working with world class researchers in physics and astronomy,&rdquo; Thomas said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Diana Dragomir Ph.D., assistant professor in the physics and astronomy department, said they do a lot of data analysis. &ldquo;It will be a lot of programming to manipulate, plot and interpret data. Students working with other faculty may spend most of their time in a lab running experiments or building instruments. It&rsquo;s uncommon, but there can be some field work with some faculty,&rdquo; Dragomir said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dragomir also said one of the students she supervised through this program is now a graduate student working alongside her, and another is now an engineer at Boeing. &ldquo;The student said, unprompted, that summer was one of the best experiences of her life,&rdquo; Dragomir said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>UNM Solar Splash is one of the senior design capstone project options for Mechanical Engineering students, with students from other engineering majors often participating to assist with the boat&rsquo;s electrical systems. Students spend the academic year leading up to the competition designing and constructing a solar-powered boat. Participants include universities from around the U.S. and abroad. The team&#39;s technical reports and videos are also scored prior to several sprint, slalom, and endurance races.</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"280\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/leS8d2C78Ok\" width=\"480\"></iframe></p>

<p>In addition to placing first overall, the UNM team was recognized with the Outstanding Electrical System Design Award. The students also placed second in the solar endurance and slalom races, and third in the sprint race and Outstanding Technical Report category.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was the best boat the UNM students brought to the competition since our university began participating in Solar Splash almost a decade ago,&rdquo; Peter Vorobieff, faculty advisor for the UNM team, said. &ldquo;Solar Splash provides the students with a realistic experience of what an entire path from a concept to a working product looks like in modern engineering, including some less glamorous aspects like fundraising or dealing with supply-chain issues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This year, students named their boat &ldquo;Unaltered Carbon&rdquo; as a nod to the carbon fiber used to construct it and a play on the title of Richard Morgan&rsquo;s science fiction novel &ldquo;Altered Carbon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Students on the UNM competition team include Kristina Ji, Silas Murphy, Jesus Martinez, Isaiah Deane and David Sabol.</p>

<p>The sponsors of this year&rsquo;s competition were the UNM School of Engineering, mechanical engineering alumnus Roger Koerner, David Menicucci, Sandia National Laboratories, DHX Electric Machines&nbsp;and SendCutSend.</p>

<p>UNM has competed in Solar Splash since 2016. The program is funded almost entirely through donations.

<p>Cha spoke about her new book, <em>A Just Transition for All: Workers and Communities for a Carbon-Free Future.&nbsp;</em>The talk was attended by a diverse audience of community organizers, University of New Mexico faculty, staff, students&nbsp;and members of the public.</p>

<p>Cha, a seasoned climate policy researcher who also works with advocacy organizations and unions, discussed the life cycle of extractive energy production and the resulting economic hardships to communities when the local source is depleted, referencing the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, the nation&rsquo;s large coal-producing area. Currently,&nbsp;Wyoming relies on coal mining for nearly half the state budget; the depleted supply negatively impacts both local and state economies.</p>

<p>Cha advocated planning for energy transition as fossil fuel use declines and creating long-term funding streams to support impacted workers and communities displaced by fossil fuel plant closures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Cha is one of the academics who has pioneered thinking about how to ensure that the transition to a low-carbon economy benefits all communities, especially fossil fuel worker communities,&rdquo; said College of Population Health Assistant Professor and co-convener Shannon Sanchez-Youngman.</p>

<p>The Grand Challenge Just Transition team also envisions an inclusive system for energy transition, according to Gabriel Pacyniak, Professor at the Law School and team co-convener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;New Mexico is well-positioned to be a leader in the low-carbon economy, but we are also very dependent on the fossil fuel industry &ndash; we are the second-largest producer of oil in the United States &ndash; and we have a high proportion of low-income people,&quot;&nbsp;Pacyniak said.&nbsp;&quot;We will need to collectively develop and implement effective policies that support fossil-fuel dependent communities in attracting new industries and jobs, and making them accessible to all New Mexicans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 2019 New Mexico Energy Transition Act (ETA) directs the state to move away from coal and toward clean energy and provides support for communities through the Energy Transition Economic Development Assistance Fund and Displaced Workers Assistance Fund. The Just Transition team is currently analyzing ETA supports provided to displaced coal power plant workers after the closing of the San Juan Generating Station in northwestern New Mexico. They&rsquo;ll also be working with the state to support and evaluate new workforce development programs for oil and gas workers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re grateful for the support from UNM&rsquo;s Grand Challenges program &ndash; we&rsquo;ve been able to use that support to bring in speakers like Dr. Cha,&rdquo; said Melanie Sonntag, research assistant professor at the Center for Social Policy and team program coordinator &ldquo;Not only has this support allowed us to learn from these speakers &ndash; it has helped us connect with nationally-prominent scholars and policymakers working on these issues.&quot;<br />

The Grand Challenges program was launched in late 2018 by UNM President Garnett Stokes. Grand Challenges are problems of global, national, and regional significance that require researchers to work together across disciplinary boundaries to develop and implement solutions. Grand Challenges address problems that, when solved, have a significant positive impact on people and society. The University of New Mexico is the state&rsquo;s leading research institution, making it the ideal location in which to situate complex interdisciplinary research work.<br />

A special place&nbsp;inside <span>PA&Iacute;S&nbsp;</span>with all types of&nbsp;tools and machines to build things that can&rsquo;t exactly be purchased at the store.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all to support research within their department and all areas across campus, such as the College of Engineering (COE), Center for High Tech Materials (CHTM), Chemistry and Biology, along with&nbsp;various departments in the Health Sciences Center (HSC).</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of different research projects on campus that need custom fixtures made, support, infrastructure for experiments happening, so anywhere on campus, we&rsquo;re available for that,&rdquo; said Anthony Gravagne, the senior&nbsp;<!--StartFragment--><span data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\">machinist&nbsp;</span>at the <a href=\"https://physics.unm.edu/\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Department of Physics and Astronomy</a> Machine Shop.</p>

<p>He believes the shop has been operational since the 1950s for the same purpose: to aid in research. Gravagne said the shop assisted with satellite infrastructure in the 1960s and supported the on-campus observatory. While machine shops are not&nbsp;unique&nbsp;to universities, UNM&#39;s Physics and Astronomy machine shop is distinct because it contributes to broader research, working for other departments across campus, as well as for several outside entities, including nonprofits, national labs, and the New Mexico Museum of Natural History &amp; Science.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are several notable designs the machine shop has created, such as making and maintaining the&nbsp;large physics demos in&nbsp;PA&Iacute;S&nbsp;<!--StartFragment--><span data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\">and Regener lecture halls,</span>&nbsp;and previously&nbsp;<span>fabricating some support frames for dark matter research. </span></p>

<p><span>&quot;These were large acrylic frames that we had to make, detectors&nbsp;that went deep underground into mines,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t always know all the science behind the stuff we make,&nbsp;I get the drawings and sketches and they say make this.&quot;</span></p>

<p>Generally, research faculty and graduate students utilize the services in the machine shop. A&nbsp;student shop&nbsp;is also built into the area, where trained graduate and undergraduate students can use the equipment.&nbsp;Nearly seven years ago, the shop moved to its current location in PA&Iacute;S&nbsp;from UNM&#39;s north campus at Lomas and Yale, where the new critical care tower now stands.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=\"textImage textImage-center\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; width: 400px; font-size: 90%; font-style: italic;\"><img align=\"center\" alt=\"as-pa\" author=\"\" class=\"widget-image\" custom_size=\"true\" data-imgheight=\"225\" data-imgwidth=\"400\" file_id=\"6837875a3d63324c5073d724\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/175/files/20254/as-pa.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" /></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After 20 years at the machine shop, Gravagne expresses great pride in his work and&nbsp;supporting research missions across various fields.</p>

<p>&quot;A lot of the research we have been involved in has been beneficial for medicine, X-ray technology, and general physics advancements over the years, so I&nbsp;take pride in knowing that I was able to help with that in some small way,&quot; he said. &quot;It&rsquo;s not so much just coming into work and making the same thing over and over again. It&rsquo;s a chance for me to assist in the research mission for the university at large and&nbsp;build my skill set doing it, in a way that&rsquo;s beneficial to&nbsp;the state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shop will cost you $25&nbsp;an hour.&nbsp;There are several other machine shops across UNM&#39;s campus, such as&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://engineering.unm.edu/research/facilities.html\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">College of Engineering&#39;s&nbsp;Mechanical Engineering Machine Shop</a>&nbsp;and facilities in CHTM on the south campus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protected bike lanes are associated with nearly double the number of bike ridership than standard bike lanes, according to a new paper published in Nature Cities.</p>

<p>The paper, titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44284-025-00255-5\">The link between low-stress bicycle facilities and bicycle commuting,&rdquo;</a> reports that protected bike lanes see about 1.8 times the number of bike commuters than standard bike lanes do and 4.3 times as many as blocks without bike lanes.</p>

<p>UNM&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://civil.unm.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-profiles/nicholas-n.-ferenchak.html\">Nick Ferenchak</a>, associate professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering and director of the Center for Pedestrian and Bicyclist Safety, led the research. <a href=\"https://architectureandplanning.ucdenver.edu/our-people/person-profile/Marshall-Wesley-UCD22363\">Wesley Marshall</a>, professor of civil engineering at the University of Colorado at Denver, co-authored the paper.</p>

<p>The researchers examined six years of longitudinal data across 14,011 blocks in 28 U.S. cities to make the determination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cities that seek to boost bicycle commute mode shifts should focus on implementing low-stress bicycle facilities if they want to best facilitate the sizable population of less-confident potential riders,&rdquo; Ferenchak said.</p>

<p>According to Ferenchak, the results can be interpreted as validation of the stress-based planning tool known as Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress. Civil engineers use tools like this to help determine what street infrastructure is suitable for bicyclists of different ages and experience levels. The less stressful an area is to bike ride in, the more people will utilize it.</p>

<p>To compare the different types of bicycle facilities, or lane styles, Ferenchak and Marshall first looked at cities with more than double the national average of bicycle commute mode share using the American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Fourteen cities with high levels of bicycle commuting were paired with cities of similar population size, geographic area, climate and function that have substantially lower levels of bicycle commuters. In order to complete the analysis, they used historic bicycle maps, interviewed city employees, and examined historic images from Google Earth and Google Street View. Then, they classified groups of street blocks by type of bicycle infrastructure and mileage of each type.</p>

<p>Researchers found that while standard bike lanes increase the number of bicycle commuters compared to streets with no bike infrastructure, protected bike lanes and buffered bike lanes encourage even greater numbers of bicycle commuters. While a greater number of bicycle commuters may not be a city&rsquo;s primary end goal, it could help lower fuel consumption, emissions, and transportation costs while producing better health outcomes and greater safety for bicyclists.</p>

<p>Ferenchak leads the <a href=\"https://www.pedbikesafety.org/\">Center for Pedestrian and Bicyclist Safety</a>, a Tier-1 University Transportation Center funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The center&rsquo;s goal is to eliminate pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities and serious injuries through research, education, technology transfer and workforce development.</p>

This important digital archive provides public access to previously sealed legal documents related to clergy sexual abuse cases in New Mexico.</p>

<p>The collection was established as a part of the settlement between the Archdiocese of Santa Fe and victims of sexual abuse perpetrated by its clergy members. This first batch of documents consists of deposition transcripts related to lawsuits against the Archdiocese in the 1900s, 2000s, and 2010s. Overall the collection includes depositions, personnel files, church administrative records, and other legal documents from the settlement. These documents, now available in digital format, serve as a crucial resource for survivors, researchers, journalists, and community members seeking greater transparency and accountability in institutional abuse cases.</p>

<p>&quot;New Mexico was an epicenter of Catholic sexual abuse in the US; the state gained the reputation of a &ldquo;dumping ground&rdquo; because priests who abused young people landed frequently here. But in a remarkable development, the Archdiocese of Santa Fe handed over its &ldquo;abuse files&rdquo; to UNM as part of its bankruptcy settlement. Now UNM is the first university in the US to hold a Catholic sexual abuse archive,&rdquo; said Kathleen Holscher, associate professor of Religious Studies and American Studies. Holscher also holds the endowed chair of the Roman Catholic Studies at UNM. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Archdiocese of Santa Fe Institutional Abuse Collection is one of the largest publicly accessible collections of clerical abuse documents anywhere, and one of the largest collections related to Catholicism in the U.S. Southwest outside the Church&rsquo;s own holdings. In addition to being a critical resource for survivors and the public, the UNM abuse archive is an extraordinary opportunity for scholars interested in religion and abuse, as well as Catholicism in New Mexico and the U.S. Southwest,&quot; added&nbsp;Holscher.</p>

<p>This release represents the initial segment of a larger digitization effort. The CSWR staff working on this collection consists of Portia Vescio, university archivist, and Avi Woontner, library information specialist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Working with the collection has been a huge challenge for us in a number of ways. We had to set up a whole new technical infrastructure to work with the files. Then there was the subject matter. Some of the files are very tough to read,&quot;&nbsp;said Vescio.&nbsp;&quot;We have recognized that working with these files means that we have to pay attention not only to the work getting done, but also to the mental health of the person doing the work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the first collection of its kind here at UNM. Early on, we discussed different ways to make the collection available and ultimately decided that we would put the materials online for people to access.&nbsp;It seems fairer to all&nbsp;researchers since we know people from different parts of the country&nbsp;and even in different parts of the world&nbsp;want to see what is in these files. We also knew that since staff had gotten emotional looking at the files, that perhaps the researchers would like to be in the privacy of their homes when they access the files.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vescio and Woontner continue to prepare the remaining documents for public access. As Vescio mentions, the collection will be completely available online. CSWR plans to release more materials through intermittent updates over the next month, depending on the process of this first batch. The CSWR is dedicated to preserving historical records and believe that access to this documentation is essential in acknowledging past harms and supporting continued healing and justice.</p>
