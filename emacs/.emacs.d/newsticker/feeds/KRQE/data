<p>Police say the shooting happened at the Comfort Inn Albuquerque Airport. APD said police interactions with 39-year-old Jorge Eduardo Dominguez began on May 27, when officers were called to recover stolen tools from a trailer. Dominguez was seen unloading items from a trailer that was reported as stolen. The SWAT team tried to barricade Dominguez, but he was able to escape. On May 28, police were able to track Dominguez to the hotel and determined what room he was in. APD said SWAT was able to set up a perimeter while search warrants were being drafted. Police called Dominguez on the hotel phone and tried to get him to surrender. </p>



<p>Dominguez attempted to leave the hotel, but ran back inside his room when he saw police. Dominguez then jumped out of a second-story window. A police K-9 was released and was successful in stopping the suspect. As officers approached, Dominguez produced a gun, and shots were fired. Dominguez was killed on scene, and the police K-9 was shot and killed in the exchange.</p>



<p>“Anytime we have an individual fleeing from officers, the safest thing we can do is use a K9. It's unfortunate and sometimes it's difficult for the public to comprehend, but a K9 is meant to save lives,” said Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina.</p>



<p>Police found a loaded Glock 42 next to Dominguez. APD said there is no evidence he fired any rounds. Dominguez had 10 bullet wounds. Both officers who fired their guns are back to duty after the shooting. The incident is still under investigation.</p>

<p>The K-9 Rebel, a Belgian Malinois, was described as a loyal, courageous, and valued member of APD for five years. APD says it is believed Rebel was killed by friendly fire during the incident. “You know, our canines are here to save and preserve human life. They are here to preserve human life, both of suspects and officers. And this was a difficult situation like mayor said, you know, he did lose his life to friendly fire,” said Chief Harold Medina. That statement by Chief Medina came during a fundraiser announcement honoring Rebel.</p>

<p>The alert went into effect at 8:15 a.m. and was extended to 10 p.m. on Monday. The city offered these tips on navigating health alerts:</p>



<ul>
<li>\"Limit your time spent outdoors and avoid outdoor exercise.</li>



<li>Schools and senior citizen facilities may want to provide indoor activities to minimize exposure to elevated outdoor particulate levels.</li>



<li>Keep windows and doors closed. If needed for comfort, use air conditioners or heating systems on recycle/recirculation mode.</li>



<li>If symptoms of heart or lung disease occur, (including shortness of breath, chest tightness, chest pain, palpitations or unusual fatigue) contact your health care provider.</li>



<li>Individuals with heart or lung disease should follow their health management plan from their health care provider.</li>



<li>Asthmatic individuals should follow a prescribed asthma management plan.\"</li>
</ul>



<p>The morning haziness is mostly dust from thunderstorm activity on Sunday afternoon between Gallup and the Gila Wilderness of New Mexico, according to the City of Albuquerque. There is also some smoke in the air that may be from the same general area. \"There are several large wildfires in southwest New Mexico,\" the City of Albuquerque stated in a news release. \"Satellite imagery from yesterday afternoon showed extensive smoke north to south through the Rio Grande Valley and also over southwest New Mexico.\"</p>

<p>“Great cities are built by great communities, and this grant helps celebrate the people and neighborhoods that make Albuquerque special,” said Mayor Tim Keller in the news release. “Whether it’s music, food, or just good conversation, we’re excited to help residents turn their streets into spaces for connection and celebration.”</p>



<p>The grant funding is being distributed by the Metropolitan Redevelopment Agency and the block parties must be held in one of the 22 designated Metropolitan Redevelopment Areas across Albuquerque.</p>



<p>Those areas are highlighted on the map below and can be found by <a href=\"https://www.cabq.gov/mra/redevelopment-areas\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.cabq.gov/mra/redevelopment-areas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">clicking here.</a></p>

<p>Applications must be submitted at least 60 days before the event date, and they will be reviewed on a rolling basis until funds are depleted.</p>



<p>Before applying, the city said applicants must collect verifiable signatures of support from at least 70% of the businesses or property owners on the party block(s). Only the blocks receiving the 70% or more level of support will be included in the party block boundaries.</p>



<p>“Block parties are a powerful way to build community and bring energy back to our streets,” Terry Brunner, MRA director, stated in the news release. “Whether you’re a local business, a neighborhood group, or just someone with a great idea, this grant helps make it happen.”</p>



<p>MRA sponsorship can be used to pay for permits, insurance, social media ads, hire a DJ, an ice cream truck, or rent games, according to the city. Funding is awarded competitively, emphasizing free entry to the block party or free activities. </p>



<p>Applicants can receive up to two awards a year; however, priority will be given to new applicants. </p>

<p>The tour kicks off on June 27 in Washington, D.C., with a special edition hosted by Scott Van Pelt, and then on July 2, Anchor Christine Williamson will be covering the Albuquerque Isotopes game against the El Paso Chihuahuas at RGCU Field at Isotopes Park.</p>



<p>The broadcast from the stadium will start at noon MT, which is the same time the game will begin.</p>

<p>NMSOP has said publicly that as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, it is not obligated to disclose its donors or lobbying expenditures.

<p>Before the Peñasco Least chipmunk was listed as endangered, Robinson explains that it was considered imperiled for decades. The chipmunk's distribution and range is now far smaller than it once was. That reduced range makes wildfires more of a pressing threat to the species. \"One fire that burns up the big trees and the other vegetation that it needs could be could lead to extinction,\" said Robinson. \"As well as droughts... the ongoing drought that may affect its supply of food, for example gooseberry currents, which are watered by snowmelt and, of course, as we get less and less snow even in the high country, there's a chance that that food source is going to become more and more restricted.\" </p>



<p>Another threat for the chipmunk includes habitat loss, primarily livestock grazing which reduced and even eliminated some resources the Peñasco Least chipmunk relies on. There's also the concern of feral hogs proliferating in the mountains where Peñasco Least chipmunks live. \"Those threats include disease transmission from hogs, direct predation by hogs on chipmunks that didn't catch them, or do catch some small mammals and prey on them,\" said Robinson. \"And then probably the most most severe threat from hogs is simply just habitat destruction. They root around, they eliminate food sources for a variety of small animals.\"</p>



<p>Robinson added that \"global climate change and the long-term catastrophic drought that the southwest is in\" are other major concerns when it comes to preserving the Peñasco Least chipmunk. There's also a ski resort at the edge of Lincoln National Forest that could pose a threat, according to Robinson. That even includes during the summer, when a mountain bike could potentially run over a chipmunk. \"Normally if a mountain biker runs over an animal, well, that's a terrible thing for that animal, but not for the species or subspecies as a whole,\" said Robinson. \"But again, with low numbers, those kind of perils can't be ignored.\"</p>



<p>When it comes to their role in the ecosystem, Peñasco Least chipmunks can be seed dispersers. They're also prey to common animals. Although they may not play the most \"integral\" role, Robinson believes their conservation is just as important. \"I wouldn't say that if the Peñasco chipmunk disappeared that this would cause the collapse of the ecosystem or the loss of another animal,\" said Robinson. \"But what would happen is a beautiful animal that's found only one place on all of planet Earth would be gone, and that place being the Sacramento Mountains and the White Mountains, would lose just a little bit part of their uniqueness and beauty and what makes them special. The Peñasco chipmunk, once gone, like other endangered species, can never be replaced.\"</p>



<p>The next step in the effort to save the species is the formation of a rescue team consisting of federal biologists, sometimes state biologists, and oftentimes academic experts. \"This little critter can be saved, should be saved, and New Mexico and the nation should be able to look back in 20, 30, 40 years and say,\" said Robinson. \"'That was a close call, but thank God we actually did save this critter.' That's what I hope will happen.\"</p>



<p>Robinson added that he hopes the Peñasco Least serves as a lesson to start getting animals on the endangered species list sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Chacon and Hurtado are accused of extreme abuse and neglect leading to the death of Mary Melero, a 38-year-old woman with developmental disabilities. Melero was found in the back seat of a white passenger van by Customs and Border Patrol agents.

<p>In light of that, Yelp has mapped out which communities across the country have had an increase in bed bug-related searches, and luckily, New Mexico cities didn't make the list. However, the northeast and Midwest parts of the United States lead the pack.</p>

<p>Atlantic City, NJ, Columbus, OH, and Las Vegas, NV make up the top three cities with the most bed bug search queries. Two Oklahoma spots (Oklahoma City and Tulsa) made the list as well.</p>



<p>The study warns that bed bugs aren't only found in hotels. Gyms, cabs, rideshares, planes, basically anywhere in public that a lot of people would go. Yelp urges people to remember that when they travel, they should try to keep their bags and personal items off the floor. Take a few minutes to inspect mattress seams, upholstered seats, and bags for signs of bed bugs, which look like small reddish-brown spots or dark specks. When you get back from a trip, immediately wash clothing on high heat to help eliminate potential stowaways.</p>

<p>According to the DOJ, between October 2021 and April 2023, the individuals operated in Luna County, New Mexico, and would coordinate pickups at the U.S.-Mexico border and move migrants from New Mexico to Arizona. Officials said the group used peer-to-peer money transfer apps to facilitate payments for services.</p>



<p>Rosa Adriana Lopez-Escobar, a.k.a. “Tia Rosa” (Auntie Rosa), a Guatemalan citizen, oversaw a network of mid-level smugglers who recruited foot guides, drivers, and caretakers for the unauthorized migrants, according to court documents.</p>



<p>Lopez-Escobar and co-conspirators, also of Guatemala, Franklin Leonardo Chilel-Ramirez, Junior Vanegas Portillo, Jose Denilson Lopez Chilel, all illegally resided in Phoenix, Arizona, while Mildred Yanira Lopez-Ambrosio and Deysi Marisela Lopez-Ambrosio illegally resided in Long Beach, California.</p>

<p>Other individuals who also pleaded guilty for their role in the human smuggling operation were Jose Gianluca Lopez-Perez, of Phoenix; Sebastian Rolando Cortez, of Tempe, Arizona; and Carlos Chavez-Hernandez, of Avondale, Arizona.</p>



<p>To date, four defendants have been sentenced. Portillo was sentenced to 37 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release; Cortez was sentenced to one year of probation; Chavez-Hernandez was sentenced to time served and two years of supervised release; and Chilel was sentenced to 45 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Sentencing for the remaining defendants is pending.</p>



<p>As part of his plea agreement, Chilel agreed to forfeit several items, including two guns, ammunition, a 2017 Chevrolet Camaro, a 2017 Ford Mustang, a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado, and a 2020 Polaris Can-Am Side by Side UTV.</p>

<p>Before the Peñasco Least chipmunk was listed as endangered, Robinson explains that it was considered imperiled for decades. The chipmunk's distribution and range is now far smaller than it once was. That reduced range makes wildfires more of a pressing threat to the species. \"One fire that burns up the big trees and the other vegetation that it needs could be could lead to extinction,\" said Robinson. \"As well as droughts... the ongoing drought that may affect its supply of food, for example gooseberry currents, which are watered by snowmelt and, of course, as we get less and less snow even in the high country, there's a chance that that food source is going to become more and more restricted.\" </p>



<p>Another threat for the chipmunk includes habitat loss, primarily livestock grazing which reduced and even eliminated some resources the Peñasco Least chipmunk relies on. There's also the concern of feral hogs proliferating in the mountains where Peñasco Least chipmunks live. \"Those threats include disease transmission from hogs, direct predation by hogs on chipmunks that didn't catch them, or do catch some small mammals and prey on them,\" said Robinson. \"And then probably the most most severe threat from hogs is simply just habitat destruction. They root around, they eliminate food sources for a variety of small animals.\"</p>



<p>Robinson added that \"global climate change and the long-term catastrophic drought that the southwest is in\" are other major concerns when it comes to preserving the Peñasco Least chipmunk. There's also a ski resort at the edge of Lincoln National Forest that could pose a threat, according to Robinson. That even includes during the summer, when a mountain bike could potentially run over a chipmunk. \"Normally if a mountain biker runs over an animal, well, that's a terrible thing for that animal, but not for the species or subspecies as a whole,\" said Robinson. \"But again, with low numbers, those kind of perils can't be ignored.\"</p>



<p>When it comes to their role in the ecosystem, Peñasco Least chipmunks can be seed dispersers. They're also prey to common animals. Although they may not play the most \"integral\" role, Robinson believes their conservation is just as important. \"I wouldn't say that if the Peñasco chipmunk disappeared that this would cause the collapse of the ecosystem or the loss of another animal,\" said Robinson. \"But what would happen is a beautiful animal that's found only one place on all of planet Earth would be gone, and that place being the Sacramento Mountains and the White Mountains, would lose just a little bit part of their uniqueness and beauty and what makes them special. The Peñasco chipmunk, once gone, like other endangered species, can never be replaced.\"</p>



<p>The next step in the effort to save the species is the formation of a rescue team consisting of federal biologists, sometimes state biologists, and oftentimes academic experts. \"This little critter can be saved, should be saved, and New Mexico and the nation should be able to look back in 20, 30, 40 years and say,\" said Robinson. \"'That was a close call, but thank God we actually did save this critter.' That's what I hope will happen.\"</p>



<p>Robinson added that he hopes the Peñasco Least serves as a lesson to start getting animals on the endangered species list sooner rather than later.</p>" "https://www.krqe.com/news/new-mexico/the-state-of-an-endangered-chipmunk-found-only-in-new-mexico/" (26704 35385) old 21 nil nil ((title nil "The state of an endangered chipmunk found only in New Mexico") (link nil "https://www.krqe.com/news/new-mexico/the-state-of-an-endangered-chipmunk-found-only-in-new-mexico/") (creator nil "Nicole Sanders") (pubDate nil "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 21:18:49 +0000") (category nil "New Mexico News") (category nil "Home") (category nil "Latest News") (category nil "Top Stories") (category nil "New Mexico") (guid ((isPermaLink .

<p>What started as a typical Saturday night at the laundromat turned violent in a matter of seconds. Newly obtained surveillance video from XXL Washers on San Mateo Blvd. and Zuni Rd. showed exactly what led up to 15-year-old Michael Rowe being shot and killed back in December.</p>



<p>KRQE News 13 spoke to Rowe's sister days after the shooting, and she said what happened was a senseless act of violence. \"There's never anything that anybody can do that should cause you to take another person's life,\" said Sarah Rowe in December 2024.</p>



<p>Video that night showed Rowe and two girls sitting, waiting for their load to finish up. Moments later, a woman, Jamel Coriz, walks up to the trio. A criminal complaint said that's when an argument begins over the use of a washing machine.</p>



<p>Coriz went to punch one of the girls, and for more than five minutes, the group continued to throw punches and kicks, back and forth.</p>



<p>Eventually, Coriz walked outside and left, but it didn't end there.  Six minutes later, Coriz returned with her boyfriend, Oscar Orozco. Orozco walked inside the laundromat and confronted Rowe, who was now alone, and chased him outside.</p>

<p>What started as a typical Saturday night at the laundromat turned violent in a matter of seconds. Newly obtained surveillance video from XXL Washers on San Mateo Blvd. and Zuni Rd. showed exactly what led up to 15-year-old Michael Rowe being shot and killed back in December.</p>



<p>KRQE News 13 spoke to Rowe's sister days after the shooting, and she said what happened was a senseless act of violence. \"There's never anything that anybody can do that should cause you to take another person's life,\" said Sarah Rowe in December 2024.</p>



<p>Video that night showed Rowe and two girls sitting, waiting for their load to finish up. Moments later, a woman, Jamel Coriz, walks up to the trio. A criminal complaint said that's when an argument begins over the use of a washing machine.</p>



<p>Coriz went to punch one of the girls, and for more than five minutes, the group continued to throw punches and kicks, back and forth.</p>



<p>Eventually, Coriz walked outside and left, but it didn't end there.  Six minutes later, Coriz returned with her boyfriend, Oscar Orozco. Orozco walked inside the laundromat and confronted Rowe, who was now alone, and chased him outside.</p>



<p>Orozco chased Rowe around vehicles at the back of the parking lot before he fired a gun at Rowe's back. Video from outside the laundromat picked up Coriz yelling at Rowe for starting it, before Coriz and Orozco got back in the car and took off.</p>



<p>Rowe was taken to the hospital but died shortly after. Orozco is behind bars awaiting trial.</p>

<p>In New Mexico, an exposure was reported at the Albuquerque International Sunport last week. An exposed traveler told KRQE News 13 that the New Mexico Department of Health said they would have to report her to TSA unless she got vaccinated. She then feared they wouldn't let her fly back home to Albuquerque.</p>



<p>\"This is a measles outbreak in 35 states, or 35 jurisdictions, almost 35 states across the U.S. and Canada, and Mexico. It's just kind of unprecedented, over a thousand cases,\" going on to say, \"it might've been said, you can't travel,\" said Miranda Durham, Chief Medical Officer of NMDOH.</p>



<p>If you were traveling on Tuesday from 3 to 7 p.m., and were in the main terminal or went through the TSA security checkpoint at the Sunport, you were likely exposed to the airborne disease.</p>



<p>NMDOH contact traced people on the flight who were directly impacted. One traveler said she couldn't remember if her vaccines were up-to-date, so the state suggested she get the MMR vaccine, which left her scrambling to get one while on vacation. \"New Mexico Department of Health is just really recommending that people, before they travel, be sure to get vaccinated or be sure of their vaccine status,\" said Durham.</p>



<p>For those exposed and uninterested in getting the vaccine, NMDOH recommends a 21 day quarantine.

<p>A very weak cold front will move into New Mexico from the northeast, bringing breezy winds to eastern New Mexico behind the front into early Wednesday morning. It won't brin ga lot of relief though, cooling high temperatures off by only a couple degrees Wednesday afternoon. Highs will still be near to above average for this time of year. An isolated shower and thunderstorm or two may develop in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. </p>



<p>High pressure builds back over New Mexico Thursday, bringing back even hotter temperatures across the state Thursday through Saturday. High temperatures will again approach 100° in Albuquerque Friday and Saturday. Winds may get a little breezy in northern New Mexico Friday and Saturday. </p>



<p>Our first taste of the monsoon will begin to move into New Mexico Sunday as moisture moves in from the south. Most of the rain will evaporate before reaching the ground Sunday afternoon. But more tropical moisture will continue to surge north into New Mexico early next week.

<p>A very weak cold front will move into New Mexico from the northeast, bringing breezy winds to eastern New Mexico behind the front into early Wednesday morning. It won't brin ga lot of relief though, cooling high temperatures off by only a couple degrees Wednesday afternoon. Highs will still be near to above average for this time of year. An isolated shower and thunderstorm or two may develop in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. </p>



<p>High pressure builds back over New Mexico Thursday, bringing back even hotter temperatures across the state Thursday through Saturday. High temperatures will again approach 100° in Albuquerque Friday and Saturday. Winds may get a little breezy in northern New Mexico Friday and Saturday. </p>



<p>Our first taste of the monsoon will begin to move into New Mexico Sunday as moisture moves in from the south. Most of the rain will evaporate before reaching the ground Sunday afternoon. But more tropical moisture will continue to surge north into New Mexico early next week. This will bring in widespread chances for showers and thunderstorms by next Tuesday.</p>

In February 2023, law enforcement stopped a van at the U.S. - Mexico border and found 38-year-old Mary Melero. She was drugged, unresponsive and covered in bruises and injuries. Melero's caretaker Angelita Chacon and her girlfriend, Patricia Hurtado, were arrested and charged for the death. Court documents say the two women removed their ankle monitors to travel out of the state and violated a no contact order. A judge ruled to put both women back behind bars until their trials. </p>

<p>In the 1880s, after Albuquerque was designated the division point between the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway (AT&amp;SF) and the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad (A&amp;P), railroad shops and a roundhouse were built on the site now known as Rail Yards Market. </p>



<p>AT&amp;SF purchased A&amp;P in 1902, beginning to expand and modernize the old A&amp;P shops in 1912. The first few buildings that were completed include the storehouse, roundhouse, freight car shops, and power station. These structures, which have since been demolished, were located south of the Bridge Boulevard overpass, which is adjacent to a still-standing complex. Every building completed between 1915 and 1925 remains to this day.</p>

</aside>
</div>


<p>In 1919, the shops became Albuquerque's largest employer, with about a quarter of the city's workforce operating steam locomotives. However, as AT&amp;SF moved from steam to diesel locomotives, activity at Rail Yards began to decline throughout the 1950s. The railroad moved its diesel repair facilities to a new location, scaling back Albuquerque operations to maintenance-of-way equipment repair shops through the 1980s. </p>



<p>The city of Albuquerque purchased the complex in 2007 for $8.5 million with various plans to reuse the space, including as housing, the Wheels Museum, a digital film studio, and a retail and exposition center. In 2013, the city, hoping to rent out the Blacksmith Shop for special events, invested $900,000 to renovate and stabilize the building. Since 2014, the Rail Yards Market, a weekly farmers' market operating May through October (with special holiday events), has been held in the Blacksmith Shop.</p>

<p>The city of Albuquerque plans to renovate a second building in an effort to add more space for the Rail Yards Market, as well as other special events. The <a href=\"https://www.krqe.com/news/albuquerque-metro/construction-at-albuquerques-rail-yards-focused-on-building-film-training-center/\">New Mexico Media Arts Collective</a> is currently constructing the Eric Witt Media Arts Center in the Boiler Room with a 2026 target completion. This facility aims to offer workforce training for the film, TV, and digital media industries with a virtual production stage, administrative offices, and a 20,000-square-foot soundstage.</p>



<p>Since the 2000s, Rail Yards has become one of the most recognizable filming locations in New Mexico. The site has been portrayed as everything from a shady meeting spot for undercover operations to a rough landing site for the Hulk. The shops can also be seen on the season five DVD cover of \"Breaking Bad.\"</p>

<p>In the 1880s, after Albuquerque was designated the division point between the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway (AT&amp;SF) and the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad (A&amp;P), railroad shops and a roundhouse were built on the site now known as Rail Yards Market. </p>



<p>AT&amp;SF purchased A&amp;P in 1902, beginning to expand and modernize the old A&amp;P shops in 1912. The first few buildings that were completed include the storehouse, roundhouse, freight car shops, and power station. These structures, which have since been demolished, were located south of the Bridge Boulevard overpass, which is adjacent to a still-standing complex. Every building completed between 1915 and 1925 remains to this day.</p>

<p>In 1919, the shops became Albuquerque's largest employer, with about a quarter of the city's workforce operating steam locomotives. However, as AT&amp;SF moved from steam to diesel locomotives, activity at Rail Yards began to decline throughout the 1950s. The railroad moved its diesel repair facilities to a new location, scaling back Albuquerque operations to maintenance-of-way equipment repair shops through the 1980s. </p>



<p>The city of Albuquerque purchased the complex in 2007 for $8.5 million with various plans to reuse the space, including as housing, the Wheels Museum, a digital film studio, and a retail and exposition center. In 2013, the city, hoping to rent out the Blacksmith Shop for special events, invested $900,000 to renovate and stabilize the building. Since 2014, the Rail Yards Market, a weekly farmers' market operating May through October (with special holiday events), has been held in the Blacksmith Shop.</p>

<p>The city of Albuquerque plans to renovate a second building in an effort to add more space for the Rail Yards Market, as well as other special events. The <a href=\"https://www.krqe.com/news/albuquerque-metro/construction-at-albuquerques-rail-yards-focused-on-building-film-training-center/\">New Mexico Media Arts Collective</a> is currently constructing the Eric Witt Media Arts Center in the Boiler Room with a 2026 target completion. This facility aims to offer workforce training for the film, TV, and digital media industries with a virtual production stage, administrative offices, and a 20,000-square-foot soundstage.</p>



<p>Since the 2000s, Rail Yards has become one of the most recognizable filming locations in New Mexico. The site has been portrayed as everything from a shady meeting spot for undercover operations to a rough landing site for the Hulk. The shops can also be seen on the season five DVD cover of \"Breaking Bad.\"</p>
