<h4>Frequency Illusion</h4>
<p>I'm sure you have!</p>
<p>It's been happening to me a lot lately; I don't try to find any meaning or pay too much attention to it, but I find it very amusing! It's like a fun little game.<br />
But I have to confess, sometimes a part of me tries to come up with meanings, or I act like I'm in the Matrix or something! Though I usually end up moving on very quickly after having fun for a bit.</p>
<p>My latest example of <em>Frequency Illusion</em>, aka the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon, was just a couple of days ago, when I decided to finally look up a manual for an old watch I have, which had been going off every night at around 12 am. The watch was in a box, in a room where it didn't bother anyone, but whenever I stayed up late to do things in said room, I could hear the alarm go off, three times, every five minutes, and then stop.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/skeleton/w-753-front.webp\" alt=\"W-753 - Front\" /></p>
<p>This went on for some months, and a week ago I decided it was time to do something, as I'm packing up my things for Japan, and having a watch with me could be useful, especially since I'm planning on replacing my current phone with a Japanese flip phone. I'm tired of smartphones. That reminds me, in the last couple of months I ended up &quot;acquiring&quot; 3 watches, despite never being a watch person, but that's a story for another post.</p>
<p>Where was I? Right, I had to look up the manual for my old watch; I had to know how to turn off the alarm and fix all the other settings.<br />
When I checked the model on the back, there I saw it:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/skeleton/w-753-back.webp\" alt=\"W-753 - Back\" /></p>
<p>For a little context, this watch was a gift from one of my grandparents, when I was a very young kid, just starting school, I believe? I probably wore it for two weeks before forgetting about it, and my mom ended up putting it away. Now, around 15 years later, I found it again, and the story I told you about happened.</p>
<p>So, where's the <em>Frequency Illusion</em>? Well, some years ago, like most guys in the world, I became a huge fan of Rome, everything Rome, and I still love Rome; I think about it every day, all the time! I hate how real the meme is...<br />
And one of the things I never forget about Rome is how it was founded on the 21st of April... <strong>753</strong> BC.<br />
One of my favorite dates, that I never forget and always think of, suddenly has a connection with my first watch, that I received as a gift over a decade and a half ago?<br />
Not only that, the watch is pretty good! Not very fashionable, or at least not my style, but it has a bunch of fun and useful features and modes.<br />
Feels like the kind of watch that you would wear during &quot;rough outdoor activities&quot;, like hiking, climbing a mountain, beach stuff... which... I'm gonna be doing in Japan?!</p>
<h4>What is going on?!</h4>
<p>Okay, see where I'm coming from?</p>
<p>I &quot;find&quot; an old watch, a gift from a grandparent that I love. I decide to tweak its settings after months of not paying attention to it, years if you're counting that. It is connected to one of the things I obsess over, because of the model number, and it's also gonna be super useful during this new chapter of my life in the Land of the Rising Sun?</p>
<h4>Isn't this fun?</h4>
<p>\\</p>
<h4>That's all! I hope to see you again soon! ★</h4>

"html")) "<p>i read an interesting comment on my recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmzsS9Jx4YQ\">beastieball track</a>, that they were surprised to hear my work on beastieball being &quot;outside my comfort zone&quot; or drastically different from what i usually write.</p>
<p>and it's an interesting thought to me because so much of what people assume about you comes through what becomes popular or what gets noticed. when you're a freelance artist, you generally get to do what you get hired for. and anything else that you release comes about possibly from the free time you manage to get.</p>
<p>my most popular work is for celeste, and it remains so to this day. is celeste indicative of everything i love to write? not everything! it's a snapshot of me in a tumultuous time in my life, writing music to accompany a similarly tumultuous girl on a journey of understanding. it's me pushing up against my limits at the time. which doesn't diminish the importance it has for a lot of people, of course.</p>
<p>is minecraft the most indicative project for who i am as a composer? 90% no, since i was hired to write music that fits into an existing soundtrack, with very specific requirements for how it needs to fit into the soundscape.</p>
<p>the 10% that is 100% me? those discs people apparently love: pigstep, otherside, creator. these are tracks where i was given full creative control, no restrictions, just make something fun. so that's where i went! pigstep is a jam because i just wanted to write something fun after months of feeling pent up.</p>
<p>but there's another side to this, because it's music written for a corporation that takes control of it &amp; gets to use it for anything it wants. otherside very frequently gets misunderstood as a cheerful piece of music. i think it's a very angry piece. a forced smile when you're burning up inside. but at the end of the day, i have to detach myself from corporate-owned music.</p>
<p>i am a bit of a weird egg when it comes to writing music. i write music best when it's for something. it's very difficult for me to write a piece of music unless i know exactly what it's being written for, and so a lot of the time it comes about from concept albums, soundtracks, etc.</p>
<p>a lot of my 'solo' work exists because of big big emotions i was feeling and needed to express in music form. many of these emotions were sad or melancholic, and so my work on singularity &amp; oneknowing reflected those emotions.</p>
<p>but the kind of music i LOVE to write? music like <a href=\"https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/beastieball-original-sound-track\">beastieball</a>!! are you kidding me? this is my comfort zone. this is my funny little bird nest full of trinkets and baubles. <a href=\"https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/changing-of-the-tide-1999\">listen to what i was writing in 1999</a>!! i was 15 years old and writing silly little game music tracks. that was my dream. you know who remembers the game <a href=\"https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/panic-at-multiverse-high\">panic at multiverse high!</a>?? probably two people: myself and the game's creator. but i was given creative control over writing music for a weird &amp; silly visual novel and so i wrote 32 tracks of SNES/GBA style music that is absolutely flooded out the gate with everything i love about music.</p>
<p>i'm currently working on my game anothereal &amp; finding myself floating in between worlds. it's manifesting something. getting the chance to work on beastieball activated a long-dormant gene suppressed by years of trying to feel &quot;presentable&quot; in the game industry. you know what it feels like to be dying on the inside because no one is hiring you to write the music you love to make? made me think that maybe i screwed up by trying to linger in AAA games as long as i did. because seeing what everyone else was <a href=\"https://tobyfox.bandcamp.com/album/undertale-soundtrack\">just doing without permission</a>... i understood that it was possible to live in my comfort zone and express myself like that. it feels good to be able to express myself in a language that isn't just what gets classified as 'serious music' by a greater art community.</p>
<p>so, anyway. just thinking about that when i reflect on what people perceive about my music. in a few more years, this will be normal.</p>

(updated nil "2025-06-13T16:02:00+00:00") (author nil (name nil "tala") (email nil "hidden")) (content ((type . "html")) "<p>Two years ago, I used to meet with a professional counsellor every week. I had pushed myself into the classic academic overachiever burnout, from years of relentlessly high performance, unrealistic expectations, and not enough rest. I needed someone to talk to.</p>
<p>One thing my counsellor often accentuated was my self-awareness. Or, more accurately: my <em>hyper</em> self-awareness. Of course, that made me feel good about myself. I felt validated - I am someone who <em>gets it,</em> who can articulate my feelings and trace its origins.</p>
<p>I started contemplating the question: <em>am I too self-aware?</em>, when I realized that all our sessions were following the exact same rhythm. I would articulate a feeling, name that emotion, and pinpoint the root cause - all by myself. Throughout the session, I would also predict how my counsellor was going to respond. &quot;I am afraid of failure,&quot; I would admit, and before she could jump in with her explanation, I would have already cut in: &quot;. . .Because growing up I was programmed that love was earned through achievements.&quot;</p>
<p>Going to these sessions started feeling a bit pointless (looking back at it, it really wasn't). And, frankly, it made me infuriated, because if I <em>know</em> why I am feeling that way, why aren't I getting better? Why am I still struggling? That gap, between knowing and healing, was frustrating.</p>
<p>I believe everyone needs to possess some degree of self-awareness. We need to be in conscious tune with our feelings, thoughts, and actions: How am I feeling today? Why am I suddenly feeling angry? Do my actions align with my values?</p>
<p>But too much self-awareness — when it turns into a ceaseless over-analysis of our lives — becomes noise. These days, I am trying to quiet the endless commentary in my mind, to stop dissecting every single emotion and understand its cause. Healing isn't always about figuring everything out. Not everything needs to be over-explained or resolved on the spot. Maybe it should be about giving ourselves permission to feel, without the urgency to fix it all. Sometimes we should just let ourselves be.</p>

"html")) "<p>Heya! Kami here.
Today I wanna talk about <a href=\"https://forkingmad.blog/i-want-to-comment-on-your-blog-post/\">this blogpost</a> made by forking mad that advocates for adding comment sections to your blog.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the comment section is probably the single worst thing to have ever happened to online discussion.</p>
<p>I don't mind if you add one to your blog - you do you.
I just really don't like them and will do my best not to use them if i can.</p>
<p>Lemme explain.</p>
<p>First of all:</p>
<h2>No. I don't want to make an account just to comment on your blog.</h2>
<p>And I don't want my replies to things to be scattered across twenty different indieweb services. Believe it or not, but when I write something I would like to be able to still find and read that a month, two years, or even 10 to 20 years in the future. I want to have <em>some</em> kind of reassurance that when I communicate with you I will have records of that that last and are easily accessible in one place.</p>
<p>I trust herman to keep bearblog around for a while. And I can export all of my bearblog data and back it up somewhere else. I can't do that with most comment sections, at least not easily. And I don't trust every comment section provider to be around forever or to not wipe my comments. I don't want to have blind faith in the uptime of the 25 different comment services people use.</p>
<p>Second:</p>
<h2>They're probably the worst medium for communication.</h2>
<p>Comment sections make it very easy to comment on stuff. That is the problem. Part of the reason discussion on bearblog is fairly civil compared to most other social media is the fact that there's no comments on most blogs. When you want to make a response you have to either email the person or write a response post. That small barrier to entry cuts out most idiots. Because you have to actually <em>care</em> about what you have to say to sit down and write an email or to make an entire response post. You have to put in <em>some</em> effort. And I think that that's generally condusive to online discussion. Because it means the people that read the first five sentences or just the headline of your post and then get mad and write something stupid can no longer do that. You don't get that completely meaningless drivel you get on, say, youtube. And if you just want to say &quot;good job&quot;, you can absolutely do that. I'd say it's <em>more</em> meaningful in the form of an email or response post. Because it shows you cared enough to put in some effort to deliver that message. If you just kind of enjoyed a blogpost and want to show appreciation, there's the toast button. If you want to offer any deeper criticism or express your appreciation in a more nuanced way, write an email or make a response post.</p>
<p>Sure, you might say: Oh, just delete the stupid comments. I guess, you can do that, but the problem is that the format <em>encourages</em> that sort of interaction. People generally tend to be more terse and less thourough in what they write. Because, well:
They don't know what your comment section allows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does it remove comments with <em>any</em> links?</li>
<li>Does it just remove comments that have a lot of links?</li>
<li>Does it remove comments with swear words?</li>
<li>Does it remove comments from people with &quot;untrustworthy&quot; email hosts?</li>
<li>Will it just throw an error if i submit my comment? I have no clue if the people running it are at all competent.</li>
<li>Does it have an upper character limit? If yes, will it tell me or just throw the comment away silently?</li>
</ol>
<p>So, you generally play it safe. You don't cite sources, you use safe language, you write small comments.
At least I do. Because I don't know if the people running your comment section have any idea what they're doing, and how much they allow. My response blogposts are essentially just comments. These are the kinds of comments i posted on social media before i started writing blogposts. Does your commenting service allow for comments this long? And there's that sort of implicit assumption that comments are temporary. They're not made to last, so people write them like they're not made to last. They just tend to say whatever and move on. It's a format that encourages short quips, trite jokes and &quot;gotcha moments&quot; and discourages people genuinely engaging with a topic.</p>
<p>Third:</p>
<h2>They have horrible UX</h2>
<p>Comment sections encourage just shouting into the void.
As I just said, they're a terrible medium for communication. Let's say I give you some feedback about your post via your comment section and you respond.</p>
<p>Here's some scenarios for how that could play out:</p>
<p>The comment service doesn't have email notifications:
I don't ever see your comment, nothing happens.</p>
<p>It does have email notifications but I misspelled my email:
Also nothing happens - In contrast, email clients usually tell you when the email you're trying to send to doesn't exist. And obviously, the email you're sending from would be correct.</p>
<p>I spelled my email correct and get the notification:<br />
Now I have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open my Notes app, because I have yet to see a comment section that saves your comment draft so it doesnt disappear when you accidentally refresh (this has happened to me enough times on mobile to have probably stolen a couple hours of off my lifespan. I write long comments.)</li>
<li>Copy my comment from the notes app</li>
<li>Open the email app again and click on your link</li>
<li>Finally paste in my comment</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;Oh, but what If you can just reply via email and it appears in the comment section&quot; - Congratulations, you have reinvented the concept of a mailing list. Go become a kernel.org contributor or something. Also I haven't heard of any comment section that actually does this.</p>
<p>Fourth:</p>
<h2>There's no situation where they are the ideal form of communication.</h2>
<p>If I want to talk to you privately, i send you an email. Comments are public, so that's obviously not a use-case here.</p>
<p>If I want to talk to you publicly, I make a response post. People not on your blog will also be able to see that in bearblog discovery - When I respond to something publicly, i generally want it to be seen.</p>
<p>If I want to talk to you publicly, but not so publicly that lots of people end up seeing it, I make it so the blogpost doesn't show up on bearblog discover. You can still see it in your analytics if i link to you. It's on my blog, which is the canonical representation on all the stuff i post publicly online, and is a place that <em>I</em> control. Not some tech startup.</p>
<p>If I care enough to want to respond publicly but don't care enough for it to be worth making a blogpost, then I <em>guess</em> it would be optimal? But I don't think that's a situation anyone has ever been in. Making a blogpost isn't <em>that</em> hard compared to just commenting.</p>
<p>Firth:</p>
<h2>Does your comments host care about my rights?</h2>
<p>I don't know. I don't want to read the TOS to find out. For example, komments.cloud &quot;conditions of use&quot; say:</p>
<p>&quot;you relinquish all ownership of the content of the comment, beyond being credited for writing it.&quot;<br />
I would like to own the things i write, thank you very much.<br />
I don't have the time or energy to look this up for every commenting service.</p>
<p>I also don't know if your commenting service lets me easily delete all my comments.</p>
<p>Maybe, at some point, I realize that I want all my data to be gone off of that service. Maybe they did something terrible. Maybe I just felt like doing it. Maybe it's some mysterious third reason. Under EU law, it is my right to be able to do that, but often big (and small) tech companies just don't respect it, and I certainly do not have the time or money to be able to get a lawyer involved in those cases.</p>
<p>Bearblog has a &quot;delete my blog&quot; button that deletes my blog and all the stuff i made. Does your commenting service? No guarantee. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. Who knows. I'm alright with this when it comes to email because there's not one big entity that controls all of my emails. There's my email provider, sure, but I only have to do research <em>once</em> on whether or not I can delete my account there, and not every time i send an email to a different person.</p>
<p>It's kind of inherent to the format that you can't delete your mails from other peoples inboxes. Emails aren't public, and they're not controlled by one entity and are an open standard, so I'm far more comfortable with not being able to delete stuff i send over there. A commenting service is none of those things. According to komments.cloud's privacy policy they will let me delete my account, but I do not want to have to read a privacy policy every time i want to comment on a site that uses a different service. And privacy policies and enforcement of those policies can change. I do not want to have to keep track of this.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I left regular social media for bearblog precisely <em>because</em> it doesn't have comment sections. I don't mind if anyone adds one to their blog - they can obviously do that - but I don't think they should be on <em>every</em> blog. I certainly won't ever add one to mine. This isn't because I don't care about what other people have to say; it is precisely because I <em>do care</em> that I hate comment sections. If someone has something to say to me, they should make a response post or email me. Or, I don't know, stalk me on the internet to figure out where I live and then send me a carrier pidgeon. That would still be a more effective way to communicate.</p>

"html")) "<p>I watched someone practice guitar in a living room last weekend, windows wide open to the street. They'd been playing for three months and sounded exactly like someone who'd been playing for three months — which is to say, terrible. The neighbors could hear every missed chord, every fumbled transition, every moment where the music stopped and started again like a car that wouldn't turn over. The guitarist didn't care. They were too busy learning.</p>
<p>Here's what stopped me cold — this person had solved a problem I didn't even know I had. Years ago, I used to record voice memos in my closet like some kind of audio vampire, terrified my half-formed thoughts might escape into daylight. They'd simply opened the windows and gotten on with the business of being bad at something.</p>
<p>This is the thing about embarrassment — we think it's protecting us from something real, but mostly it's protecting us from something we made up. We've constructed this elaborate theater where other people are the audience and we are forever auditioning for a role we don't even want. The part of flawless &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot;, who struts out of the womb fully competent, ready to deliver a TED Talk on life mastery, never had to learn anything, never struggles, never fumbles, never has to start over, never looked stupid while figuring it out.</p>
<p>Someone once told me that the biggest barrier to growth isn't lack of talent or opportunity — it's the fear of being witnessed in our incompetence. They weren't talking about a character flaw. They were naming the fundamental choice between performance and transformation. You can spend your whole life perfecting what you already know, or you can step into the territory where you don't know anything yet. The territory where you look exactly like what you are: a novice.</p>
<p>Most of us choose performance. We write our novels in secret. We start businesses we never tell anyone about until they're already successful. We practice our skills in private until we're good enough to not look foolish. We think this is maturity, but it's actually a sophisticated form of hiding.</p>
<p>The problem isn't just that we miss out on feedback, though we do. The problem is that we never <a href=\"https://prickly.oxhe.art/\">develop the capacity to exist in the space between stories</a> — between where we are and where we're going. We never learn to be comfortable being uncomfortable while other people watch. We stay small not because we lack ambition, but because we lack the tolerance for being seen in our unfinished state.</p>
<p>I think about the writers whose novels live forever in drawers, waiting to be &quot;good enough&quot;. The entrepreneurs whose brilliant ideas die in the safety of never being tested. The people who suffer alone rather than ask for help, because asking means admitting they don't have it figured out. They're all protecting the same precious, impossible thing — the illusion that competence comes before action, that we transform in private and then unveil ourselves, fully formed.</p>
<p>But that's not how anything works. Not change, not learning, not belonging. We become ourselves in relationship to other people's eyes, other people's feedback, other people's witness to our stumbling. The embarrassment isn't the enemy of the process — it's the system working exactly as designed.</p>
<p>When we're embarrassed, we're in the exact place where growth lives. We're pushing against the edges of who we think we are. We're discovering that our self-image is smaller than our actual capacity. The discomfort isn't telling us we're doing something wrong; it's telling us we're doing something new.</p>
<p>This requires a different relationship with failure, with looking foolish, with being seen before we're ready. It requires understanding that the person who has it all together is also the person who has stopped growing. That polished competence and active learning are actually incompatible states.</p>
<p>The fear of embarrassment masquerades as concern about other people's judgment, but it's really about our own <a href=\"https://prickly.oxhe.art/coachability/\">attachment to being someone who doesn't need help</a>, doesn't make mistakes, doesn't have to start over. It's about the violence we do to ourselves when we insist on being experts and refuse to be beginners.</p>
<p>When you stop protecting that image, you start to discover what you're actually capable of. Not the safe, manageable version of your capabilities, but the true ones — the kind that emerge when you're willing to be awkward, to ask stupid questions, to try things you might fail at.</p>
<p>The people who grow fastest aren't the most talented. They're the ones who can tolerate being witnessed in their incompetence — the ones who can stumble publicly and somehow make it look intentional. They've made peace with the gap between their vision and their current skill level. They've learned that embarrassment isn't just the price you pay for growth — it's the cover charge for <a href=\"https://prickly.oxhe.art/before-allowed/\">entering any room worth being in</a>.</p>
<p>So the question isn't how to avoid embarrassment. The question is — what becomes possible when you stop letting the fear of looking foolish keep you from the very thing that would make you less foolish? — What are you not learning because you're afraid to be seen learning it?</p>

Separated by over 8000 kilometers, my sister and I have known of each other's existences for a decade. Only a few days ago did we finally reunite.</p>
<p>We met in an unfamiliar country that I never expected to host our reunion. Kazakhstan is similar enough to Russia though and is cool in its own way, of course.</p>
<p>It was actually less emotional than expected. I thought at least one of us would cry when we first met, but not a single tear was shed. The first moments of meeting were awkward. Again, no tears, but all I could do in the moment was ask how she is doing even though I already knew the answer to that question. She asked for permission to hug me. Why didn't I think of doing that in the first place?</p>
<p>Despite our similarities, I immediately thought we looked more different than photos made us out to be. We have the same eye color, but her eyes are rounder than mine just like her face. We've made quite different choices with our lips and eyebrows. She's skinny, almost frail, perhaps due to coping with work- and marriage-related stressors that made her cut her time with me short from about a week to merely 2.5 days.</p>
<p>Whenever I ask her, she thinks she looks like neither our mother nor our father. More like her maternal grandmother. I think she doesn't want to admit the truth: that she looks very much like our father who, to put it lightly, treated our mother like shit, got into alcohol, wanted nothing to do with my sister and saw her all of two times, and threatened to leave her mother if she kept me. Our mother chose neither of us, raising my sister alone briefly before finding a new partner and having a son with him. I look more like our mother. Interesting that we look like the respective parent who abandoned us.</p>
<p>Though of course, I cannot lie: among other similarities, it was comforting to see someone with the same eye color as me even though she said mine are grayer than hers. In terms of appearance, there are probably just as many commonalities as there are differences. As she is less than 11 months older than me, I wondered if people looked at us and thought we're fraternal twins.</p>
<p>At the same time, I couldn't help but feel like I was getting a taste of my own medicine. Our temperaments are too similar. I could only shake my head when she repeatedly refused to let me cover the full price of less than $4 for a taxi ride that both of us needed to take. Yet for some reason she insisted on paying for my ride on the metro. So, I guess the money thing worked only one way.</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes almost out of their sockets when I received text messages from her prefaced with the phrase &quot;if we see each other tomorrow . . .&quot; as if I weren't the one to initiate our reunion in the first place, fly to the other side of the world, learn my birth language so I can competently communicate with her in person, and gift a photo album with dozens of photos documenting my life for her and her family. Why wouldn't we see each other as long as we are both in the same city? My friends say it's like fighting tooth and nail to get me to accept even the smallest amount of help, but I like to think I'm not as stubborn as my sister.</p>
<p>Then she asked if she's supposed to return the photo album to me after I specified initially that it's for her.</p>
<p>But maybe it was something to do with me. Was I being cold? Something is wrong with me, perhaps, having been rejected from my birth family and birth country and denigrated by my adoptive family for my whole adolescence. All that can't be a coincidence.</p>
<p>As I detailed earlier, I don't know how to be a sister. Maybe I don't even know how to be a human being. After all, human beings are fundamentally connected to other human beings. I, however. am untethered, and it's easy for me to stay that way as I can break ties with another person like ripping off a bandaid.</p>
<p>Every day I had to fight the compulsion to shy away and give both of us space as she inched so close to me to look down at the map I used to navigate ourselves around Almaty that I felt her hair brush against my forehead. I don't even really come that close to my best friends after years of contact. Maybe unfamiliar blood relatives are granted special permissions from the git-go and no one told me.</p>
<p>Later, a small pack of stray dogs came howling and barreling down the top of a quiet street we were exploring. We both immediately froze. Until my sister grabbed my hand for dear life, insisting she doesn't fear dogs but still demanding me to be quiet and pulling me along with her. I'll admit they intimidated me a little, too. I didn't grab her hand back though. Instead I let my hand, the size of a nine-year-old's, hang limp in my sister's grasp. For some reason her hands are normally sized.</p>
<p>For the first 1.5 days I felt bad that I didn't feel as much as I was &quot;supposed to,&quot; an amount that is surely unquantifiable but something that my brain still wants to be tangible. Things were going well, and it was no surprise that they were given our similar personalities and interests. We walked more than planned, but she didn't complain much. I walk fast according to her. We talked when we both wanted to talk, and we naturally fell silent as we coincidentally started feeling bad or tired at the same time. We were in sync.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was awkward, and this person -- my blood relative, the first one I ever met, and the only one born from the same mother and father as me -- who voluntarily flew to see me felt like a distant friend from elementary school. Attached at the hip all day until we retreated to our separate accommodations, where we could recount our impressions to the members of our polar opposite worlds.</p>
<p>I felt there was some sort of power dynamic, even though she may not have, or, if so, in the opposite direction. For me, it was not just because she is older and more experienced in some ways, already with a soon-to-be ex-husband and the owner of two small businesses. Rather it was more about me, the rejected sibling, here to hang out with the one who was kept. And I was the one to request this. As much as she emphasized how lost she feels in her life as a result of the situation, maybe I'm the needier one.</p>
<p>Plus, I had to cope with all this in my third language. It wasn't hard necessarily because I am still learning Russian. But every moment of success after expressing a complex thought and realizing that I was speaking more or less at ease with my sister -- something unimaginable five years ago as I stumbled through Duolingo -- was accompanied by perpetual unworthiness that comes with trying to prove yourself in the language of the country that as a whole rejected you. Before the trip, she bought a course in English so that we could speak in my language, too. We ended up speaking Russian only. I expected that though.</p>
<p>Thankfully, things improved. Eventually she opened up and shared some of the things that were previously left to my imagination via text, instead promised to be explained in person. Just as I felt my brain on the verge of imploding after speaking in Russian for a number of hours that would surely exhaust me even in my native language, some sort of bond started to form. Maybe it was the pressure of our meeting approaching a close that was able to bring out the topics that brought us to Kazakhstan in the first place; otherwise, I think our mutual tendencies for avoidance would have continued to sweep them under the rug in favor of small talk.</p>
<p>I found myself often feeling bad for her, though it's clear that she has a strong psyche and there is no way I can really help her anyway. I pitied her so easily, and it was unsettling in a way that made me genuinely wonder if I am too hard on my own self.</p>
<p>On Friday we went to the airport very late at night for her flight at 4:30 AM. I stayed with her until nearly 2 AM until my accommodation for my remaining days in Almaty summoned me for sleep. While saying goodbye, she admitted the time was too short. She hopes we see each other in another country again someday. I have this same desire. Still, I wasn't sure if she was saying that to be nice (an American thing, but who knows) and maybe she didn't like me as much as expected. Or at all. This time, I initiated the hug. And that was all. Goodbye until whenever.</p>
<p>I don't know what to make of it. It went well, but I don't believe it actually happened. More emotions will almost certainly surface after I exit vacation mode. I'm torn: On the one hand, perhaps I am actually much stronger and was even overprepared for our reunion. Or maybe I am so weak that I didn't open up enough out of fear.</p>
<p>In any case, I think we walked away with a better understanding of ourselves and each other. I can only hope that the experience alleviated at least a morsel of the shame my sister feels surrounding her family for a &quot;choice&quot; only her mother could make that in reality was more of an obligation thanks to what unraveled from the breakup of the Soviet Union and a shitty relationship. I don't blame her, but my sister does. And herself.</p>
<p>I'm walking around Almaty feeling lighter than before, likely thanks to seeing myself in someone else for the first time. A privilege that most take for granted. I feel a little less like an alien, for whatever that's worth. And while I doubt I will ever fully recover from my adoption, I made a big step in a matter of days that even quality therapy, though helpful, could not touch for years.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, it feels like a new beginning rather than a resolution to many years of disillusionment, shame, and longing. Not necessarily just with my birth family, though I am nervous to see what will become of our contact. I wonder what she's told her mom, stepfather, and brother about me. Did I meet expectations? Fall short?</p>
<p>Naturally, the next step, which I always thought was the first, is to return to Russia. It still seems disappointingly unrealistic anytime in the near future. But given this priceless experience as well as being perceived (unsurprisingly) as a Russian in another post-Soviet (icky, I know) country, my American and Russian selves — at odds with each other and neither feeling quite right — feel slightly less distinct from each other. Maybe even 10% in harmony. For now.</p>

"html")) "<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>On end of March'25 I wrote the part 1 of this series <a href=\"/debunking-the-unsafe-c-myths-part-1/\">here</a> and although at the end of that article I mentioned we are going to finish the rest of the video, I felt the test was boring since I knew the results would be: all these &quot;unsafe&quot; C practices would be caught by either static analyzer or dynamic sanitizer.</p>
<p>Hence it would not bring any real challenge ~ boring! But fear not! I found a better, much nastier challenge...it is in the form of X/twitter conversation I had with Dmitry, who writes <a href=\"https://github.com/Nekrolm/ubbook/blob/master/README_ENG.md\">Undefined Behaviour guide book</a>.</p>
<p>Also please visit <a href=\"https://pvs-studio.com/en/blog/posts/cpp/1129/\">Dmitry's blog</a>. You can't imagine how excited I am when I found his blog and UB-book, it is like a heaven-on-earth to me since he outlined lots and lots of the most difficult undefined behaviours in C/C++ --&gt; prime candidates for me to test with my modern C safety tools!</p>
<p>The screenshot below is taken from part-1 of Dmitry's blog.
<img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/14/dmitry_ub_00.png\" alt=\"dmitry_ub_00\" />
Focus point: <strong>a collection of the most disgusting examples</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the real deal, unlike the video I debunked in the 1st part...that was puny, kindergarten-level toy stuff in comparison with Dmitry's UB-book and I'm super ready to get absolutely trashed by the UB-book LOL !!</p>
<p>In this article I will walk you through my conversation with Dmitry.</p>
<h3>The unsafe C++ code</h3>
<p>Comment from Dmitry:</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">The fun part — it becomes significantly harder to catch all these 
issues in more complicated cases, when the bug can be triggered by 
interactions between functions 

E.g. stack use after free is not detected by asan (C++ stuff can be 
replaced with equal C)
</code></pre>
<p><img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/13/dmitry_cpp.png\" alt=\"dmitry_cpp\" /></p>
<h3>Rewrite the C++ code to C</h3>
<p>I rewrote Dmitry's C++ code to C:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/13/dmitry_cpp_rewrite_c.png\" alt=\"dmitry_cpp_rewrite_c\" />
Note: the output are the same on the left-split. I compiled using -fanalyzer on the right-split and you can see the error pointed out to the use after free / stale stack frame:</p>
<p>==logger-&gt;dest memory ref is no longer valid.==</p>
<p>Below is the lower part of the gcc static analyzer error trace:
<img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/13/stack_trace.png\" alt=\"stack_trace\" /></p>
<h3>Minor code change.</h3>
<p>Logger** passed to the callback directly instead of the global variable, this is to make the C code as close as possible to the C++ code (reference every time captured by the lambda closure)
<img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/13/dmitry_case_cpp_local.png\" alt=\"cpp_local\" /></p>
<p>Note: Logger is now local in main instead of global var. I still get the same error with gcc static analyzer. I then tried using sanitizer and it also caught the UAF, as shown in the below image:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/13/runtime_sanitizer_00.png\" alt=\"runtime_sanitizer_00\" /></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>At the end of the conversation Dmitry mentioned that he specifically crafted this example to trick dynamic analysis for C++. I'm a big fan of Dmitry's work and I will dig deeper into his blog and UB-book for the next part of this series. I still fully expect I would get absolutely trashed by one of the UBs he crafted in his UB-book and that makes me excited!</p>
<p>What's the message we can get from this exercise? Use the tools: ==static analyzer== (make sure use GCC, it's much superior compared to Clang's as shown in <a href=\"/make-c-safe-again/\">my other post</a>), ==dynamic sanitizer==, and ==Valgrind== if you want to be thorough. The C ecosystem is vast, far and wide...you'd be crazy not leveraging the use of these powerful tools available to you.</p>
<p>There's one particular tool I might cover in the future: <strong>Fil-C</strong>. In my opinion it got the potential to have widespread use because all you need is to recompile your C program using Fil-C (and maybe some minor changes to your codebase) and get a safe C program. This sounds crazy, but watch this space! If Fil-C works well, then there's no need to rewrite C programs in any other language! The only major hurdle is performance, which recompiling using Fil-C would introduce around 2x overhead. The author is targeting for a 1.2x overhead across most use cases.</p>
<p>Imagine how easy and most importantly how scalable it will be to make billions upon billions of lines of C codebase safer by recompiling them using Fil-C..</p>

<small><em>colored pencils, 2021</em></small></p>
<p>There are nights, like tonight, that remind me in ways of what it was like when I first moved to the city over 7 years ago. A fresh grad with a salary so low they had to increase the base pay for all entry level employees when minimum wage was raised because it didn't meet the threshold. At that time, I was play acting an adult, waking up each morning and soaking in every new experience with a smile a mile wide at work, spending nights berating myself for being so stupid to believe that I could do <em>this</em>, or anything, for that matter.</p>
<p>Being 21 really is giving yourself permission to be the most dramatic person in your head.</p>
<p>In the blur of all that, I decided to pick up the hobby that I had abandoned at some time between high school and adulthood, but is the reason why I'm here both in a blog sense and in an existence sense. Maybe it was an internet addiction, or maybe it was the distraction of college and shiny new drinks and boys and freedom, but at some point I stopped making things.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/andmakingand/img_7810-1.webp\" alt=\"IMG_7810\" />
<small><em>our beloved bag dog, Summer, pen, 2022(?)</em></small></p>
<p>It's true that I've been making things my whole life, but my college years are a black hole of abandoned sketchbook and empty promises to myself of making. And maybe if this were a different place or a different post I'd trace a lot of my purposelessness in those years to that misalignment of what I know to be true of myself now, with the privilege of age and retrospect. But, we're here and this is this post.</p>
<p>Back to 2018: I bought myself a sketchbook, something cheap. And spurred by so many factors - knowing only a few people in the city, having barely any money to do anything, living in a tiny room that had a single window that faced a wall across an alleyway - I spent those nights as I find myself spending the night tonight: blasting my Spotify on shuffle for hours, not saying a word, and <em>drawing</em>. Drawing and drawing and drawing, getting drunk in the feeling of it that one blurs into the next until I've lost all sense of time and I need to literally cut myself off.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/andmakingand/untitled_artwork-3.webp\" alt=\"Untitled_Artwork\" />
<em><small>the first ever self portrait I ever drew in that first 2018 sketchbook vs. tonight</small></em></p>
<p>In present day, a comment from a (new-er) friend from my ceramic studio sent me here thinking about all of this. She hadn't known that I drew at all, and when I explained to her that actually drawing is really the thing I love the most, I just get distracted by lots of other things (picture me as the mouse in give a mouse a cookie except the cookie is a new medium or craft). She responded with something that ultimately ended with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's nice to try diff things! and to always have something to go back to</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something to go back to. It reminded me of the permanence of drawing for me, the safety blanket of it. The comfort of pencil on paper, the simplicity. You can't hide in a drawing. I love making physical objects - decorative or functional, but drawing feels personal. Drawing is intimate, every sketchbook a diary of sorts. They are more intrinsically linked with memory for me than any other piece of art in my home, as is true for probably many artists. They are beautiful, and ugly, and perfect, and despicable.</p>
<p>My sketchbook holds the things even my journal is too afraid to keep.</p>
<p>My friend's comment made me <em>miss</em> drawing, as if it was a tangible thing I could hold and feel distant from. It's true, it's hard to have nights like these now with more responsibilities and more interests to balance. But I guess that's the beauty of having something to come back to. It's still waiting for you when you get there.</p>

<p>Howdy everyone! It's been a while since my last blog post since I have been busy dealing with the volatile equity markets due to the reciprocal tariff war launched by US to the whole world. Equity markets were cratering like crazy and it was one of the easiest 50-75% gain from the bottom market in 1 month you'll ever encountered.</p>
<p>Yeah I was so focused wearing my Finance-hat I totally forgot to wear my Writer-hat back. Since then I've scaled out (sold) most of the positions I bought near the bottom of the market and now I'm waiting for the next down-cycle which might take a while.</p>
<p>This waiting time means I'll have spare time to write, yayy!!</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Alright in this post I want to write about the importance of normalizing the resource cost when doing benchmarks. To make it easier to understand, imagine you're ride-testing two cars: first one with 2,500cc engine and it took 10 seconds from 0 to 150 kph.</p>
<p>The second car took much less time, 8 seconds from 0-150 kph, but it requires 7,500cc engine to achieve that. So in order to be 20% faster, it needs 200% increase in engine power.</p>
<p>If we don't normalized the resource cost, it would look as if the Second car wins hands down. But post normalizing, it becomes clear that it is far too costly for us to triple the resources in order to achieve 20% faster performance.</p>
<p>The same concept applies when analyzing levelized cost of electricity of various energy generation methods : solar photo-voltaic, wind farms, hydro, fossil fuels (coal, gas), nuclear, etc. You would be surprised seeing the numbers once we put LCOE in place : nuclear powerplant is the cheapest!</p>
<h3><a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/\">grep</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep\">ripgrep</a></h3>
<p>The tools I'm using to demonstrate the importance of levelizing / normalizing resource cost are grep and ripgrep: both are command line tools to search files for lines containing a pattern match.</p>
<p>I'm inspired by Primeagen livestream where he briefly mentioned something along the lines of: &quot;ripgrep is faster than grep, but also ripgrep uses a lot more cpu&quot;. I was intrigued by this and hence I decided to investigate deeper.</p>
<p>Below are some screenshots of the benchmark I did, pay attention to the CPU used:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Singlethreaded (ST) grep and Multithreaded (MT) ripgrep
<img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/12/01_grep_rg01.png\" alt=\"grep_rg01\" /></p>
</li>
<li><p>Both singlethreaded: ripgrep require the use of <code>-j1</code> flag
<img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/12/grep_rg_01.png\" alt=\"grep_rg-01\" /></p>
</li>
<li><p>Both singlethreaded, for the ripgrep using <code>-uuu</code> flag would yield the same 963 matches.
<img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/12/02_grep_rg02.png\" alt=\"grep_rg02\" /></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay you get the idea: in a levelized / normalized resource usage (set ripgrep thread to 1), in the test I did shows a general picture: yeah ripgrep is fast at default settings, however it also uses a lot more CPU resources. When we normalized the resource usage, it loses it's speed advantage.</p>
<h3>Ripgrep github benchmark</h3>
<p>Now let's visit Ripgrep <a href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep\">github</a>, there are some interesting benchmark numbers we can analyze:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/12/03_grep_rg03.png\" alt=\"03_grep_rg03\" /></p>
<p>Check this <a href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/benchsuite/runs/2022-12-16-archlinux-duff/raw.csv\">github page</a> to see the raw commands used in ripgrep's benchmark.</p>
<p>Did you notice something? None of the commands used <code>-j1</code> flag which is to make ripgrep singlethreaded. Hence the benchmark is not normalized at all, this means grep uses 1 thread, while ripgrep uses multiple threads. This is unfair.</p>
<p>Last screenshot, below I demonstrated using ripgrep both single and multi threaded.
<img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/12/04_grep_rg04.png\" alt=\"04_grep_rg04\" /></p>
<p>It's a bit messy, let me write the relevant output:</p>
<ul>
<li>ST grep   :  99% cpu 0.170 total</li>
<li>ST grep   :  99% cpu 0.172 total</li>
<li>ST ripgrep:  93% cpu 0.217 total</li>
<li>MT ripgrep: 789% cpu 0.051 total</li>
</ul>
<p>In ST (single threaded), ripgrep is slower (0.217 vs 0.172). In MT (multi threaded) ripgrep is blazzingly fast: 2.4x faster than single threaded grep, however it also uses almost 8 threads in order to achieve that performance vs only 1 thread for grep.</p>
<p>Is that performance worth it? I'll leave the answer to you. Looks like what Primeagen said was true after all!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This post is not an attack to ripgrep or burntsushi, not at all, the purpose of writing the article is to provide insight of how important to levelized / normalized the resource usage of the tools or programs we are using or benchmarking.</p>
<p>I encourage those writing benchmarks to start providing the resource usage data, so we the readers can determine the benchmark is normalized or not. Are you okay with having 2x faster performance at the cost of 8x more resource hungry app?</p>
<p>Someone would argue, ==&quot;having those threads idle / unused is not good either, let's use those idle threads!&quot;== Yes I agree completely with that argument, however if you want to run grep / ripgrep do you close your other apps first (e.g: running Unreal engine, Godot, VScode, Chrome with 20 tabs open 5 of which on Youtube, etc) and then run grep/ripgrep?</p>
<p>Or would you just keep all the apps open and run grep/ripgrep? Exactly my point! Unless all you do is running benchmarks all day, it's very important to measure levelized / normalized resource usage of an app.</p>
<p>For example in my daily usage, I keep 3 workspaces open:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workspace #1: standard office apps, browsers open with 20-30 tabs to do some market research, at least one of them running Bloomberg live market non-stop. Sometimes there are a couple of Youtube videos too.</li>
<li>Workspace #2: trading app (quite heavy coz I'm running an algo trade).</li>
<li>Workspace #3: programming (mostly just terminal and Neovim, but sometimes I run 5-6 Python instances either to scrape data or do some numbers crunching).</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you saying I need to close all of these apps and run ripgrep if I want to do pattern matching on files / directories? No thank you!</p>

I've been following too little blogs and most are fairly inactive now, and I get the impression that Bearblog's Discovery feed has a bit of a slow time lately.</p>
<p>My first instinct is to ask people to give me a list of their favorite blogs or check out their blogrolls; I like personal recommendations more than having to deduct anything based on just a name or a screenshot. I like when people write little blurbs about who this person is and why they're on that list. And chances are, if I like someone's blog, I'll like what they read, too, at least some of it. But that hasn't been as successful as I'd like! It also seems like we Bearblog people are a bit silo'd, since we're mostly consuming other Bearbloggers, but I wouldn't mind breaching out a bit.</p>
<p>So I remembered my <a href=\"tab:https://blog.avas.space/discover\">discover</a> page and went through most of these directories.</p>
<p>I've found I'm really a bit too rigid and not trusting enough. I can't bring myself to just middle-mouse-button-click the top 20 links of some page or filter to open in a New Tab and see what it is about. Instead, something has to pull me in - the name, a brief description, an intriguing design in the screenshot, or the fact that I've seen them around before. I'm less likely to actually go from link to link to link than I'd like to. I'm also suddenly easily overwhelmed by too many tabs open. Yes, I am one of those people that only ever has 1-4 tabs open and immediately closes unneeded ones and reads everything the same day, and I guess I am barely used to deep dives like that anymore (except for university exams). Don't know how to feel about that.</p>
<p>I'm also a bit biased against certain designs, I have to admit. It's not personal, I'm sure those sites are great for whoever they're made for, but if I see a huge &quot;Hi, I'm (name)!&quot; with the handwave emoji, I'm out. I think I've seen this design too many times before, and it also seems to be <em>the</em> standard design for when you want your blog to be a portfolio for your applications in the tech sector. Which is good for you! But not what I am looking for.</p>
<p>There is another type of blog or personal site I've been learning to avoid for myself, and it's ones with way too many columns and boxes. The content is spread out over the entire screen (on desktop) and there's a top bar to click multiple links on, but the most recent post is on the left with a giant picture, then there's other posts on the right, and below that is the latest picture they snapped, next to that is the latest book they read, and right next to that is a link collection of their postroll, and then here are multiple categories with images to quickly signify what they're about... it's all so much! My eyes dart around and I'm unsure what to do next and it feels overloaded and a bit chaotic depending on the execution and sizes. I think I prefer less images, a bit less or no boxes, and a text of links or a list of blog posts to read, centered on the page, with some unused space.</p>
<p>I admittedly have a negative connotation to accompanying posts with a picture and presenting each post as a little box with said image to click on. It reminds me a lot of clickbait, of monetized, SEO-optimized WordPress blogs and engagement at all costs, of old advice that treats your viewers like babies attracted to color. I'm not saying the people who have these kinds of sites that I explored feel that way, but unfortunately that's the message that comes across to me because of my own experiences.</p>
<p>Searching through blogs, many make it too hard to find their RSS feed link. Some of them are broken. With others, it's hard to find an about page, or an easy list of blog posts to get an overview what they talk about.<br />
Many seem to hide when a post was written, which was an inconvenience because I wanted to find out how active the blog is and when the latest post was. No point in following if the last post was 2 years ago, and I wanna know how active you are in general.<br />
Some were also a bit messy in separating the categories (some were both blog posts and notes), others made it unclear visually where a post ends and another begins.</p>
<p>When I see that most of your posts are just about changing the blog design, changing the hosting, changing the delivery method, changing what editor you write the posts in, and all that changes like every 3 months... I am not hopeful that you will ever get to the actual meat of it. Which is fine! Maybe your blog is about testing out all the tools you can use for that and reviewing it. But it just seems like those blogs were not originally set up to do that and instead, they hope to find the ideal conditions until they feel perfect enough to post. I wonder if that state will ever happen, when every tool is presented as the one that finally fits just to also fail as a new shiny thing comes along. I appreciate letting us see under the hood of it all, but I prefer a balance to the blog upkeep posts.</p>
<p>In the end, I think I added about 6-8 new sources to my web reader, many of them magazines and less than I'd like! But I'll keep looking.</p>
<h1>the type of blogs i like</h1>
<p>After criticizing websites, it's only fair to also talk about the positive things I saw and liked.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I really appreciate when you have a doodle-y, self-designed look <a href=\"tab:https://ohhelloana.blog/\">(example)</a>. Not a must, but definitely a bonus.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I like when there's a button for light and dark mode (I have to implement this myself; both light and dark mode are there, but it checks your device/browser setting instead).</p>
</li>
<li><p>It's great when there's an introduction on the landing page or an easy to access About page that quickly lists your personal information (that you're willing to share) and interests and what you're blogging about, maybe already mentioning the different tags and categories you blog about.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I prefer white, black, gray, muted colors and pastel to overly aggressive or neon colors :)</p>
</li>
<li><p>I like blogs that are similar to mine! Some opinions and thoughts, some personal life, even mundane things. Code stuff can be mixed in, but not as the main thing or in a way that is hard to understand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I like when you have a garden section with lots of links to follow, like about yourself, the blog, your interests, postrolls, blogrolls, bookmarks, shrines and more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I like the following topics a lot (not a conclusive list): Zines, Pets, Embroidery, Sewing, Pottery, Beverages (Coffee, Matcha, ...), Observations from the Coffee Shop, University Life, Indie Web, Link Collections, Repairing or modifying the tech you have, Tech Positivity (like <a href=\"tab:https://goodinternetmagazine.com/\">The Good Internet magazine</a>!)</p>
</li>

<center style=\"padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;\">This essay is a work of fiction, though inspired by <a href=\"#compulsion-to-catalogue\">my compulsion to self-catalogue</a>.</center></div>

<p>I’m trying to capture myself. I’m not sure when I first got away. I just know that I’ve been gone quite some time.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I started to notice it around age 15. This is when I had my first boyfriend. Craig. I didn’t understand what he wanted from me. I doubt he understood. We both just knew that this was what kids did. We spent our time together watching movies. We would sit on his couch, our thighs touching but nothing more. This was dating.</p>
<p>Monotony crept into our relationship, as monotony is wont to do. We said our goodbyes. We broke up. I didn’t think much of it. I doubt he did.</p>
<p>But I have to say I lost something. Something little had gone. Little, but nonetheless vital. It was like getting a sore on your tongue. It’s such a small, insignificant bump. But you feel it every second of the day. You are reminded by the sharp pain. In my boyfriend or in the movies or in the breakup or in there somewhere I had lost part of myself. But not all of me. Not yet.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’ve had other boyfriends since then. And I’ve lost more and more every time. But it’s not only them. Other things have taken me away.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>At age 17 my grandmother dies. At her funeral, I walk up to the casket. It’s not her. She’s too made-up. So I walk outside and smoke. Across the street I see this dog. A mutt, really. He’s big and brown. Not a pretty brown. A mutt brown. The kind of brown that girls buy hair dye for. He’s sniffing around some weeds. So I call to him. A generic dog call of here boy. This mutt lifts his head and looks left to right. It’s like he’s getting ready to cross the street safely. Just like they tell you in elementary school. He turns his mutt head center and looks at me. His muscles tense and he runs. That happy run that dogs do in movies. The Lassie run. The Benji run. He’s running with that much joy.</p>
<p>Then it comes. A truck. The truck. The only truck to pass down this old Florida road in the past three hours comes. And of course it hits him. Square in the side. And I have to say that took a bigger part of me than any boyfriend ever had.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Little by little I’ve fallen away from myself. People I meet carry pieces of me with them. Like dust on their sleeves. It’s so light they can’t feel it. But I can. I can feel myself disintegrating. I feel my atoms dispersed. I am disappearing.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>When I was five I had a birthday party. My mother took a picture of me blowing out the candles. I have this picture. Being five, I was still building myself. I was gaining pieces little by little, creating the person I’d come to be. That’s what kids are. They are people in the making. They are unfinished character sketches. They are collectors of identity.</p>
<p>I babysat at sixteen. I’d get paid 4 dollars an hour. This one baby I sat every Sunday. Noon to six. Joshua. He was 3 months old. Joshua liked to cry a lot. Being sixteen, I didn’t enjoy this. I’d turn on the TV real loud, trying to drown him out. When he was quiet, I’d cradle him. I’d sing to him.</p>
<p>I visited Joshua when he was five. He didn’t remember me. Of course. He wasn’t even one then. But part of me wondered why. Why I wasn’t remembered. I think that took something out of me. Not being remembered. But who can blame a five-year-old?</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Sometimes I wonder if other people feel it. The parts of them that are missing. Do they feel them leave as I do. Do they look for themselves too. I feel I’ve lost so much already. I’m so behind in picking up.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I wake up early. The sun’s not up. It’s cold in my room. They haven’t turned on the heater. My roommate’s asleep in her bed. Her breath is heavy. We breathe so shallow when we’re awake.</p>
<p>I take a shower. The water’s cold, of course. I’m on the 5th floor. In Iowa. In winter. I cut off the water and reach for my towel. It’s so cold I don’t want to touch the floor.</p>
<p>I step outside. It’s cold. The kind of cold that bites at your skin. That enters your ears. It’s that cold. Then the wind comes. And it’s colder. I can feel it reaching inside me. Clawing down my throat. Tearing at my organs. I can hear it laughing. I know that it’s trying to get me. Get into me. It’s trying to rip out my heart.</p>
<p>So I walk to class. Gasping. Thinking I’ll cough up blood any second. Thinking this is it. Thinking why the hell did I leave Florida. Thinking of that mutt brown dog.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’m working on ways to capture myself. There are several methods and tactics I have used. I created a scrapbook. Page one: here’s little Hailey, age 5, blowing out candles. Caption reads: Hailey wishes to be anywhere but here.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Back in high school in Florida, I was eighteen. I was a senior. I was in AP classes. I had some friends. It was a private school. The only good schools were private. We had to go to chapel. Every Wednesday. It was held in the cafeteria/chapel/wrestling practice room/events room overlooking the lake. The walls were windows behind the preacher. There was a bridge in view. Kids would count how many cars passed during service.</p>
<p>I took a religion class with the priest. We were required to. He told us he used to be a biker. Motorcycles. He used to do drugs. Pot. Heroin. Coke. He told us we could do our homework during chapel. He told us we could sleep. He said if we got in trouble, they would send us to him. And he would let us go. I wondered why he was there at all.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>It’s all these experiences that took me. They’d take a piece and leave their impression. You see, in order to have all these new impressions, new experiences, we have to make room. We have to let go of things. And this is how we disappear.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’m on a date. I’m twenty-two. I’m telling this guy about my theory. Luis is his name. He’s twenty-four. He appears mildly interested. So, where do you think you’re going exactly? He still doesn’t get it. I tell him <em>I’m</em> not going, it’s only parts of me—pieces. Luis is speechless. He lets a minute pass. So, where do you think your pieces are going exactly? He has rephrased.</p>
<p>You see, Luis, I tell him, when you meet people, they change you. When things happen, they change you. And whenever you’re changed, whenever you develop, you are losing something that was there before. We make room for the newness. People influence you. You take their accent. Their way of dressing. Their political opinions. And you have lost yourself. All of a sudden, you are gone. So you have to be careful. You have to catalogue. You have to track. Baby pictures. Journals. Poetry. Everything. You should keep everything, write down everything so that in all of it you can find who you really are and once were.</p>
<p>I realize suddenly that I’ve said too much. I realize suddenly that I should stay away from wine.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>So my scrapbook. Page two: little Hailey on Daddy’s knee. How cute. I can look at this for hours. Who is this person so small. I’ve got to hold onto her. I’ve got to create her life for her with these pictures that I’ve filed away. One day I will build her up so tall that she’ll finally be ready to be.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>When I was six, I learned about death. I had a fish. He was long and slender. Like an eel but smaller. Like a gray swimming earthworm. I named him Max. I loved Max because he wasn’t like the other fish. He swam differently. His eyes were black bubbles on the sides of his head. I always thought they would pop if I touched them.</p>
<p>I loved how Max could bend. He could bend unlike any of the other fish. He was more agile than them. Max was acrobatic. He’d swim in zigzags. He’d twirl. He was graceful and delicate. The other fish just wobbled. Back and forth across the tank they wobbled. Max, on the other hand, flew.</p>
<p>I came home one day to Max performing a backbend. I was astounded. I’d never seen Max do such a thing. His pointy nose was in the gravel, his bubble eyes open wide. His back formed a perfect arch. His belly up. His tail fins in the gravel two inches from his nose. There he was. Incredible. I yelled for my mom to hurry look before he stopped.</p>
<p>Max didn’t stop. My mother came in time. She did not seem as excited as I. Perhaps she’d seen Max do this trick.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>People always say that when people die, they take a part of you with them. This makes me feel understood. What people don’t realize is that when people are born, they take a part of you too.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>When I’m twenty, I’m in the hospital. My best friend is giving birth. Rebecca. She is twenty-one. It was a mistake. She’s sitting there sweating and breathing. Bodies are amazing under physical stress. She’s panting real hard and groaning. Her face is so red. All I can think of is hot coal.</p>
<p>She’s gripping my hand with the unrivaled force of a woman in labor. Her nails dig into my flesh. Hair is stuck to her forehead. She’s in a hospital gown with little blue flowers repeated a million times across it.</p>
<p>The doctor’s sitting on a stool. He’s between Rebecca’s legs. Just looking. He seems rather engrossed in something. Not Rebecca. Something in his head. He decides it’s trivial for the moment and, sighing, tells Rebecca she’ll have to push soon.</p>
<p>She pushes. Each time her hands dig deeper. I’m sure she’ll break the skin. She pushes and groans. Her face turns purple and red. I no longer think of coal. She pushes and throws back her head. Her teeth are clenched. Her face distorted. I do not recognize this colored mass of flesh.</p>
<p>She pushes and it comes. The doctor pulls out a baby. The smallest version of a person. It’s purple and red like its mother. It’s wiggling with eyes closed. The doctor asks if I’d like to cut the cord. Rebecca nods. She cannot let go of me. So the doctor comes to me with this baby and this mess and this cord. So I cut it and feel like a butcher.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>So I have written poetry. Since a child, I’ve written poetry. I used to write for my teachers. Whatever they wanted to hear. They loved it. They all kept it. And I kept writing. I’ve catalogued them now. They’re all in a book. Like my scrapbook. But words instead of pictures.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>My mother hated talking to me. Not everyday talking. Real talking. About life. About love. About death. About sex. She wanted no part of it. My sexual education consisted of the class they taught us in 5th grade. And my cousin reading the definition of sex to me from the encyclopedia when I was four.</p>
<p>When my mother and father decided to separate, my mother did not want to talk. So my father had to. This is how I learned of it.</p>
<p>Hailey, he said, Mother and I are going to separate.</p>
<p>My father was a man of few words. My mother was a woman of none.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’ve made sure to hold onto what I can. I record my voice. I record my thoughts. I journal. I’m sure that if I lay out all my findings, I will be able to see myself. If I combine it all just right, some picture of myself will form.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>One of the biggest pieces I’ve ever lost was to Roger. Roger is my prom date. For senior prom. My mother snaps a picture of us at my house. I have this picture. Roger has dark brown hair. Almost black. He spikes it with gel he gets from Walgreens for $3.99.</p>
<p>It’s warm outside. Humid. The sun is down. We wave goodbye to my mother and get into Roger’s car. Roger is 19. I am 18. I don’t know him very well. He came to my school this year from Georgia.</p>
<p>At the prom I find my friends. We make a group trip to the bathroom. The guys wait patiently. They ask me about the hotel. I don’t know about a hotel. People always go to hotels after prom, they say. I feel rather uninformed. We all apply a layer of lipstick and head out into the dance.</p>
<p>We’d always gone to a friend’s house. Maybe <em>other</em> people had gone to a hotel. Not us, though. We were good kids. I find Roger. What’s this hotel thing I ask him. He seems as surprised as I do and shrugging, asks me to dance.</p>
<p>Roger drops me off at 11pm. We say goodnight. And that was all.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Doubt is what replaces much of what a girl once was. Doubt of looks. Doubt of brains. Doubt of character. Doubt of any and all valuable and lovable traits. Soon a girl is filled with so much doubt she no longer knows anything else. Especially herself.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’m twenty-two again. I’m on a date again. This time it’s Mitchell. I’m watching my wine. I’m listening to him. He’s telling me about his truck. I can’t understand, but I nod. He asks me what I do for fun. I say I’m a collector. He asks me of what. And of course I can’t lie. I tell him of pieces. Of lost pieces. Like broken bottles, he asks me. No of people. Of me, I say. I’m collecting lost pieces of me.</p>
<p>Again silence. Awkward, this hobby of mine. I decide not to elaborate and sip on my wine. Mitchell begins talking about trucks. I nod.</p>
<p>We go on a second date. This time to the movies. My choice. I figure it’s safe. In the dark I can’t talk. Someone else’s story will take up the time. Someone easy to understand. We watch a drama. I can feel my heart pulling itself towards the screen, offering itself to the characters. I close my eyes. Not now. I can’t lose you now.</p>
<p>Mitchell walks me to my door. We kiss goodnight. His truck is running. The exhaust is billowing. He asks when can he see me again.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>My scrapbook. My poems. My journals. My sound bites. All of these catalogued, recorded, and kept. All these files of me. There is a person here.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>My gut is wrenching. I’m digging fingernails into porcelain. My body is heaving. Hair is falling in my face. I’m cradling the toilet. I’m watching all of this. I’m waiting to feel empty.</p>
<p>I come out of the bathroom. Hair is in place. Fingernails intact. I sit down at the table. My friends look up. Welcome back, they say, want dessert?</p>
<p>I smile that I’m-so-bad dessert smile and ask what they have here. Long list of delicacies. We all laugh that we’re-so-bad dessert laugh. We all order something.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Searching for yourself as I do can pass as normal if you’re careful. Everyone has scrapbooks, pictures, old letters, journals. Everyone has their own memorabilia. Mine just happens to be more extensive, my intention more defined, my search far more profound. We are all of us unconsciously searching. I have just woken up.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Back in Florida, I’m watching a horror movie with my boyfriend and his friends. This is a new relationship. I do not know these people. The movie is <em>May</em>. May has no friends. People cannot understand her. May decides to make a friend from the perfect parts of others. She kills them, cuts them up, and sews them together.</p>
<p>Everyone talks about it after. It’s bloody. It’s weird. It’s disturbing. It’s creepy. I say I thought it was funny.</p>
<p>I never hang out with these people again.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Really, I’m just writing an autobiography. Only it’s interactive. Three-dimensional. Alive and growing. It is not static as other book-bound pages are, aging with time and growing out of date. Mine continues on with every day as I slowly collect myself with every minute second moment that arises.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>In 4th grade all the girls made fun of the dark hair on my legs. They laughed at me during music class. They pointed at me in gym.</p>
<p>One night I came into my mother’s room and woke her to ask if I could shave. She sleepily told me yes. I had to remind her in the morning. She found a razor and helped me shave for the first time.</p>
<p>In music class the girls pointed, teasing me for shaving. I stopped, letting my hair grow back. Two weeks later, the girls had begun to shave. Again they laughed at the dark fuzz covering my legs.</p>
<p>This was a game I could not win.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>As a child, things seem to hit harder. But it’s a delayed pain that you feel once you’re older. It hides inside of you for years, just festering and waiting. And you think something’s wrong with your life right then but really it’s just you as a child hurt and waiting for recognition.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>So I’m twenty-one. I’ve babysat since the age of twelve. I’ve seen birth. And I’m pregnant. Not belly-out-pregnant. Yet. It’s brand-new, flat-stomach, no-one-knows-unless–you-tell-them-and-then-they-don’t-even-believe-you-pregnant. This was not intentional.</p>
<p>There begins to be an influx of babies. In the grocery store, on the television, at the mall. I start seeing them everywhere. And their mothers. So loving. So ready. So there for their children.</p>
<p>And there’s me. Frightened. Confused. Already feeling like a murderer. Like a menace to the children I see. Feeling like their mothers should guard them from me.</p>
<p>And then there’s the clinic. White walls. White ceilings. White clipboards with white forms. Who are you and where did you go wrong? Please sign here.</p>
<p>So they drug you. You’re not really asleep but not really awake. And they tell you to relax. And something inside of you dies.</p>
<p>So they put you in a recovery room with the other women. And the drug starts to make you really hot. And there are women around you stripping. Pulling off their gowns, yelling, and moving around the room in a frenzy of sweat and panic. This is a common reaction to the drug, you are told. This is another day at the clinic.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>So I’ve lost so much, you see. Every day. Every second. It’s all falling away from me. But I’m finding it slowly, and pulling it back. You have to see it. You have to see how this works. Just reading this can’t you see? There’s a person here. Can’t you make her out? Construct her, build her, create her from these pieces here, these tokens of a life laid out for you or anyone to paste together and say, “<span class=\"orange-highlight\">I know you.</span>”</p>

<center><h2 id=\"on-revisiting-hailey\" style=\"padding-top:15px; opacity:0.9; font-size:2.2rem\">On Revisiting \"Recollecting Hailey\"</h2></center>

<p>I've been thinking a lot lately about how porous our identities are: how we are shaped by every experience, every person, every bit of information we take in. And how this shaping means losing parts of ourselves...or at least who we would have been without external influences.</p>
<p>I wrote this piece in 2011, but felt myself drawn to revisit it. It pulls on so many of the tangled threads I've been exploring recently: questions of identity; of the <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#June-08-2025-10-21-AM\">devolving influence</a> of <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#May-31-2025-09-41-AM\">social platforms</a>; of <a href=\"/#fn-1\">when I'm &quot;allowed&quot; to call myself an artist</a>, writer; of how my framing and conception of myself shifts so radically depending on <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#June-02-2025-07-10-AM\">which community</a> I'm currently inhabiting; on the constant conflict I feel about what this website itself should be, <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#June-09-2025-09-01-AM\">what</a> should <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#May-22-2025-09-36-AM\">be</a> on it, <a href=\"/changelog/#page-vs-post-etc\">in what form</a>, and what that says about who I am: serious writer? artist? blogger? hobbyist?</p>
<p>In revisiting this piece—which I wrote four years before learning I am Autistic and ADHD—I unearthed a new layer of understanding my own compulsion to self-collect and self-archive. One colored by my neurodivergence and the cost to identity a lifetime of masking can take...</p>
<center><h3 id=\"compulsion-to-catalogue\" style=\"padding-top:15px; opacity:0.9;\">A Compulsion to Self-Catalogue</h3></center>

<p>This essay was borne from my compulsive drive to self-catalogue...a drive itself borne from questions I scrawled in my journal at age seven:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm having a lot of internal problems lately. I can't sort out my feelings or even who I am. I just want to be me. But, I don't know who &quot;me&quot; is. Who would I be if I wasn't under the influence of someone else? What if I had grown up alone? Would I have been a totally different person?<br><br>I know, though, that that would be me. The real, wild, untamed and unchanged me. All I need to do is find me, and maybe then I'll be happy.&quot;<br><br>— <em>journal entry from seven-year-old Emily</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As early as seven, I was concerned about my sense of self being shaped <em>(or, more so, eroded, lost, scattered)</em> by external influences. Some influences enhance, grow, or firm up our sense of self; others take, chip away, and warp. But all of them change us.</p>
<p>This journal entry was written over two decades before I'd learn about <a href= \"/space-taking-defiance/#fn-3\">Autistic masking</a> (or even that I was Autistic). I think we're <em>all</em> shaped, in one way or another, by our experience and encounters—by what we read or take in. But masking can take this to a potentially self-destructive level <em>(a literal destruction of self)</em>.</p>
<p>As an (unknowingly) neurodivergent child, I learned early on to study and approximate what I thought might be expected of me. It was a survival mechanism. It was necessary. It kept me alive. It also cost me a full sense of self. It left (and leaves) me with this unrelenting compulsion to extricate/preserve/form/find my &quot;actual self&quot;.</p>
<p>Much like Hailey, this took form in journaling, scrapbooking, cataloguing...hoping that somehow, if I captured and preserved and archived and tracked...I'd be able to assemble the whole of me. To find her. To hold onto her. To feel tethered, for once, rather than carried away—piece by piece—on the winds of an all-too-overwhelming world not built for brains like mine.</p>

<p>Well we're back with a new instalment of your favourite car restoration project, and while it's been a a few months since the last update, rumours of my demise have been wildly exaggerated!</p>
<p>I ended up spending ludicrous amounts of money on what was supposed to be only a set of imperial wrenches by inadvertently visiting Addendorff Machinery Mart in person, instead of shopping online from the safety and sensibility of my own home. Needless to say, I was pretty eager to put the tools to good use, starting with this beast of a car jack:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1a-3.webp\" alt=\"1a\" /></p>
<p>The wheels are coming off to send them to get new tyres fitted and to get access to infernal drum brakes yet again. Note the shiny new imperial sockets, ahem!</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1b-2.webp\" alt=\"1b\" /></p>
<p>While I shudder at the mere thought of having to work on the drum brakes, me and them are now on speaking terms after our long and sordid history of disassembly, reassembly and the rinse and repeating thereof. I guess once you've worked on something multiple times you start to develop a Stockholm Syndrome-esque affection for the blasted things. Behold, the epitome of my love/hate (pictured so I know how to put them back together again!)</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1c-2.webp\" alt=\"1c\" /></p>
<p>While it doesn't look like much, please know that any attempt to work on these apocalyptically tedious springs results in a quantum event occurring as a spring jettisons itself though a wormhole never to be found again.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1d-2.webp\" alt=\"1d\" /></p>
<p>Aside for the casual dabbling in Everettian Quantum Mechanics, the reason for opening all four (!!!) brake drums was to remove the slave cylinders from their respective brake assemblies to be sent, along with the master cylinder, to actual brake professionals for refurbishment. As I'm constantly reminded, going fast with a roaring V8 is hella fun, especially when you can stop again. Hence, these brake parts are off to the specialists to be made new again:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1e-2.webp\" alt=\"1e\" /></p>
<p>With the wheels off to the tyre guys, and the master and slave cylinders off to the brake guys, the Chevelle looks very much like a work in progress - and there is progress!</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1f-2.webp\" alt=\"1f\" /></p>
<p>Disappointingly, my long-awaited order from the US for new engine mounts did not include the mounting bolts for the chassis, which I should have known. So these hefty pieces of metal are going to have to go back into their boxes until I can place another order with Ivan, our friendly local V8 parts importer.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1r.webp\" alt=\"1r\" /></p>
<p>Not to bother, as there are still plenty pending jobs on this car, notably the leaking oil pan that needs to be dropped and resealed. Let's get that old oil out!</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1i-2.webp\" alt=\"1i\" /></p>
<p>Oil draining #picturesque</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1h-2.webp\" alt=\"1h\" /></p>
<p>However, as we began trying to prise the oil pan from the bottom of the engine block, it became apparent that we couldn't do it without destroying the oil pan gasket. So another part to be ordered, unless we can get creative with applying gasket maker externally to the leaking area - after all, the oil pressure is pretty low in the pan. Yet another job to be added to the backlog!</p>
<p>One of the jobs we could finally get to was connecting the flex plate to the torque converter, effectively joining the engine and transmission with these three tough little bolts:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1j-2.webp\" alt=\"1j\" /></p>
<p>Invariably, this required removing the bell housing, cleaning the torque converter and the centre button on the flex plate, lots of heavy lifting in awkward and painful positions while trying to not drop large hunks of metal on the floor through ones toes, and finally, applying the bolts and making the engine and gearbox a unified drive train. Beautiful:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1k-2.webp\" alt=\"1k\" /></p>
<p>Thank goodness I had all these shiny new tools for a job that only required two of them!</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1l-2.webp\" alt=\"1l\" /></p>
<p>Lastly, and probably the job that I was most looking forward to involved the planned destruction of offending concrete piers preventing the long-distance movement of the Chevelle. Aside for these targets of destruction being located in a swiftly coursing Crocodile River, I think I brought the right tool for the job:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1n-2.webp\" alt=\"1n\" /></p>
<p>I was expecting the remaining bridge supports to crumble easily under the mighty sledgehammer, but alas these were concrete piers enforced with none other than Pelindaba rock:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1o-1.webp\" alt=\"1o\" /></p>
<p>Even with some good support, we didn't make much of a dent - we'll be back with a bigger team, and of course more tools.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1p-1.webp\" alt=\"1p\" /></p>
<p>Lastly, while projects like these are really fun to work on, they're more fun to work on with someone else. Happy Father's Day!</p>

"html")) "<p>I tried to draft an indigenous science-fiction story over the weekend. It didn’t quite land — I’m new to Ancestral Futurism, and the narrative ended up reeking more of Jewish Mysticism. But the idea wouldn’t let go of me. Not because I didn't get it right, but because something was honest in the trying.</p>
<p>The story opens with three people, each handed an hour where the ordinary world stops being ordinary. Not magic, exactly. More like the moment when you read a book, then look outside the window and finally see it — the glass itself, the way light reflects on it, the palm prints you left before.</p>
<p>Steam rises from a cup. Footsteps echo differently down the hall. Paper rustles with intention.</p>
<p><em>The first person</em> receives an hour and immediately begins calculating its worth. Before the experience has started moving through their body, they're drafting the framework. The taste of something real becomes market research. The face of a stranger becomes case study material. They photograph the steam not because it moves them, but because that image sells transformation courses.</p>
<p>They've learned to interrupt every profound moment with the question: &quot;How do I package this for others?&quot;</p>
<p>The hour becomes inventory. When it ends, they possess content without understanding its meaning.</p>
<p><em>The second person</em> feels the weight of what they've been offered and steps back.</p>
<p>This is too precious to approach unprepared, they reason. It’s better to use this hour to study how others have navigated similar moments, building a proper framework for the next time.</p>
<p>They follow strangers who seem to be succeeding, take mental notes on their techniques, and research the proper methodology. They spend the time observing, cataloging, and constructing elaborate theories, all while remaining carefully absent from their own experience.</p>
<p>They turn the hour into a masterclass on meaning, the ultimate course on stillness, attending it as a perpetual student. When it ends, they have a detailed plan for next time.</p>
<p><em>The third person</em> let the hour happen to them.</p>
<p>No agenda. No preservation strategy. They taste what’s in front of them as if learning to use their tongue for the first time. They listen to strangers the way children listen to thunderstorms — not for information, but for the shape of the sound itself.</p>
<p>They move when movement calls them. They speak when silence breaks open. They reach toward what's reaching back. Not because they've decoded some universal principle, but because they've stopped asking permission from the voice that always wants to know why first. They become indistinguishable from what they're experiencing.</p>
<p>When the hour ends, they can't tell you what they learned because they've become what they encountered.</p>
<h3>We're all living inside that hour right now.</h3>
<p>Not the magical version. The one where coffee grows cold while you check your phone. Where conversations happen around you while you plan your response. Where the texture of your life passes through your hands like water you forgot to cup.</p>
<p>The first person's tragedy isn't ambition — it's the reflex to monetize every moment of aliveness before they've finished being alive in it. They've trained themselves to extract value from experiences they never fully enter.</p>
<p>The second person's heartbreak is subtler. They want to live, they really do. But they've confused studying life with living it, mapping the territory with walking the ground. They're saving themselves for a readiness that arrives after the moment has passed.</p>
<p>The third person isn't special. They've simply stopped trying to be someone having an experience and allowed themselves to become the experience itself.</p>
<p>There's no technique here, no method. Just the moment the edge blurs because you stopped bracing against the unreasonable life.</p>
<p>Most of us cycle through all three positions within a single day. We pitch ideas over breakfast, scroll social media at lunch, and occasionally — for reasons we avoid to explain — find ourselves completely present to the taste of wine at night.</p>
<p>The question isn't how to become the third person.</p>
<p>The question is: who is it that decides you aren't already?</p>

<p>When we talked about peer influence among students, it led us to ask: How should students be divided into classes? Should we mix students of varying abilities, or should we group them based on proficiency?</p>
<p>The discussion quickly became heated between two teachers: Ms. Tan and Mr. Amir.</p>
<p><br />
<img src=\"https://cdn.vectorstock.com/i/500p/75/97/cartoon-of-two-businessmen-kung-fu-or-karate-vector-20257597.jpg\" alt=\"Fighting between teachers\" />
\\</p>
<p>Ms. Tan said firmly, &quot;Students should be grouped according to their level of ability. It's just practical. Otherwise, only half the class is being engaged. Either the lesson becomes too difficult for lower-proficiency students, or it becomes too boring for students of higher proficiency.&quot;</p>
<p>Almost like a drama show, Mr. Amir raised his voice across the room. &quot;But how will the students feel if they're told they're in the 'slow group'? That's humiliating! Plus, what will the parents say if they see us labeling their children like that? Who will bear the backlash?&quot;</p>
<p>Ms. Tan shot back &quot;I'm not labeling! I'm acknowledging the truth. Not everyone learns at the same pace, and I'm sick of pretending otherwise. If we want results, this is the reality.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not everything is about grades and results!&quot; Mr. Amir fired back. &quot;Students who are already scoring badly have low enough self-esteem. Put them in a 'bad' class, and they'll never believe they're worth anything. Don't you care about these students?&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>Every time this debate plays out, I can’t help but notice that this isn’t just a difference in opinion. It’s a difference in how they <em>think</em>.</p>
<p>From my observations, Ms. Tan is what typology calls a Thinker, and Mr. Amir, a Feeler. While their stances are different, what’s more telling is <em>how</em> they reach their conclusions. That classroom debate isn’t just about policy. It reflects two fundamentally different ways of making decisions.</p>
<p>In a previous post, I wrote about <a href=\"https://josephlee.bearblog.dev/how-do-you-view-the-world-s-n-t-f/\">how we view the world differently</a>. In this one, I want to dive deeper into how we form judgments through <a href=\"https://www.personality.ninja/nxt-core/origin/type-tactic\">Thinking or Feeling</a>.</p>
<p>Understanding this difference can change the way we interact with others. It could be the key for Ms. Tan and Mr. Amir to finally stop fighting and start seeing each other's perspective. And more broadly, it can help improve our relationships by helping us respond more thoughtfully to other people's needs.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Thinker vs. Feeler</h2>
<p>In technical terms, Thinkers make decisions based on logic and reasoning, while Feelers decide based on values and emotional impact. Let’s break that down through five key differences:</p>
<h4>1. Logic-Centered vs. Value-Centered</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinkers ask, “Does this make sense?” They use criteria, premises, and truths to reach conclusions. It’s like solving a math problem. If the numbers line up, it’s probably right.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers ask, “What matters most here?” They weigh emotions, priorities, and how people or themselves might feel affected. Their judgment is guided by what feels important.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: A Thinker and a Feeler might both want the same guitar, but they come from different points of view. The Thinker thinks, <em>“It’s durable, affordable, and has great resale value!”</em> The Feeler says, <em>“It’s beautiful, it looks like Bon Jovi’s, and I can imagine myself playing it every day!”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Evaluates Utility vs. Evaluates Worth</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinkers assess usefulness. <em>“How does this help achieve the goal?”</em> If something or someone isn’t contributing much, they may set it aside.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers assess importance. <em>“Why does this matter to me or others?”</em>
Even if something or someone doesn’t help with the goal, they may value it because it's cherished.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: In a meeting, a Thinker wants to cut a low-performing project that's costing the organization. A Feeler might object and say, <em>“People care about this project. Maybe we can improve it instead.&quot;</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Seeks What Works vs. Seeks What’s Right</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinkers want solutions that get results. They ask, <em>“What’s the most effective or precise way to fix this?”</em> If something works, that’s enough for them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers want solutions that align with personal or shared values. They ask, <em>“Is this the right thing to do?”</em> They care about being true to themselves or about standing together with others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: At work, a Thinker might propose to lay off a senior worker who is no longer as effective as they used to be. A Feeler might push back and say <em>“He’s been fiercely loyal to our company for years. How can we just ditch him like that?”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/v42q4yVH/thinker-vs-feeler.jpg\" alt=\"Thinker vs Feeler Meme\" />
<em>Disclaimer: It's just for laughs. Thinkers and Feelers are way more complex than what two boxes can describe.</em></p>
<h4>4. Solves Problems vs. Nurtures Feelings</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>When trouble shows up, Thinkers jump into fix-it mode. They focus on solving the problem, often setting emotions aside.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers tune in to people’s emotions first. They try to understand and calm hurt feelings, believing that addressing emotions is what solves the bigger issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: A friend struggles with their restaurant business. The Thinker might offer marketing strategies to help, while a Feeler would talk about how their friend feels and attempt to cheer them up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Debates with Reason vs. Persuades with Emotions</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinkers argue by using logic. They say things like, “If this is true, then we should do that,” and expect others to follow the reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers argue by speaking to the heart. They might say, “Imagine how that would make someone feel,” or “This means a lot to me,” hoping to connect on an emotional level.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: In a discussion about school hours, The Thinker might say, <em>“Less stress leads to better focus and learning.”</em> While the Feeler says, <em>“Kids are exhausted. Don’t they deserve time to just be kids?”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Misconceptions</h2>
<p>Before you start jumping to conclusions on who's a Thinker or Feeler in your life, it’s important you understand the common misconceptions. One big misconception is confusing <em><a href=\"https://www.personality.ninja/nxt-core/energy/type-temperament\">temperament</a></em> with <em>function</em>.</p>
<p>People often assume that quiet, receptive individuals must be Feelers, while assertive, direct ones are Thinkers. This assumption likely stems from the idea that logic feels more concrete, whereas emotions seem more fluid. While that may be true to some extent, it doesn’t necessarily determine a person’s overall demeanor.</p>
<p>There’s also the gender stereotype. Men are raised to “think with their heads.” Women are encouraged to “listen to their hearts.” As a result, many men misidentify as Thinkers, and women as Feelers, even when the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Here’s a great read by <em>Personality Ninja</em> on how <a href=\"https://www.personality.ninja/article/thinker-vs-feeler-influence-of-gender-roles\">gender roles distort our perception</a>.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/break-gender-norms-concept_23-2148552118.jpg\" alt=\"Breaking gender roles\" /></p>
<p>Instead of being swayed by temperament or gender roles, try noticing how someone explains their decisions. Do they often weigh logical reasons? Or are they talking about preferences, and what’s liked or disliked by themselves or others?</p>
<p>That small shift in awareness can help you better identify who is truly a Thinker or Feeler without being tricked by surface appearance.</p>
<p>There are plenty more misconceptions I’d like to cover about this dichotomy, but I’ll save that for another post.</p>
<hr />
<p>Understanding Thinkers and Feelers isn’t about picking sides. It’s about realizing that we all just see the world from different starting points. And the fact is, both ways of judging are valid and essential.</p>
<p>The more we recognize these differences, the more gracefully we can move through the conflicts, miscommunications, and misunderstandings that inevitably arise in life.</p>
<p>So whether you’re a Thinker learning to be more compassionate, or a Feeler learning to stand your ground with logic, it helps to appreciate the strengths of the other side and learn something valuable from them.</p>

<h2>Life</h2>
<p>There was a guilt ridden goodbye to my parent's home where I was an adult-sitter. Eager to resume my normalcy, I flew back to Goa. This normalcy is essential for a greater sense of <em>accountability</em>, which is a concept I held for 10 years and have lost it in the gold mine of free time. Do people not understand how incredibly easy it is to not do anything when the pressure or requirement to do something is only internal? And not &quot;I have to feed myself&quot; internal in the gut but &quot;I must find my life's purpose&quot; internal in the mind, the kind that is supposed to feed your soul. Yes, I say <em>supposed</em>, because you know what also feeds the soul? Doing nothing, wrapped in a cosy throw and serving oneself reheated momos in a sauce that you made in 3 minutes as that is the most you bothered to do for yourself that day.</p>
<p>The other day I was lamenting to Ru that I am hungry, happy-bored, seeking activities like a child in a playschool. This is opposed to my usual mode of sad-bored or happy-busy. What a day it gave me! A <a href=\"tab:https://jigsawnation.com/in/en/?srsltid=AfmBOoo5jrjMRAkhK2jo3XoTXCloz_KNQxeH0jcUQD0X9a12bdi2p5tG\">puzzle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4\">video game</a>, a new mobile game I rediscovered called <a href=\"tab:https://www.ndemiccreations.com/en/22-plague-inc\">Plague Inc</a> where you create a bacteria and spread it across the world. There were 4 meals, and 2 coffees, both delightfully made by other people.</p>
<p>The week began with a pottery class that Smr took me too. What I made is between me, god and the bystanders. What I broke is within me. The whole concept of pottery is fascinating, I feel so human while making things with my own hands, to look at them and know if I tried, I can make a sculpture of my illicit dreams, or an ashtray. The lack of knowledge on how to turn a thought into a real thing, piled on by the lack of focussed teaching in the class has driven me nuts. Currently, I am less talented than the Neanderthals. A potter cannot be too far away from their wheel, and with that I shall return to play, with clay, and make tools and ashtrays that shame smokers who visit me.</p>
<p>In the flight to Mumbai I recognised someone, but as it was before 8AM I opted to omit small talk on both of us.</p>
<h4>So I went to Mumbai</h4>
<p>Many countable hours were spent in Mumbai. A good decision was made to meet a beloved creature, Shre, which was enhanced by the presence of their sister Sne. We were joined by good conversation and gleeful sounds. Bougee cafe near &quot;Pali Hill&quot;, a name I have only before seen in a movie, served good flat white and eggs that Shre did not let me pay for. They bargained with &quot;You can host me when I am in Goa&quot; and I have already made a note in my journal to take this love-revenge on them.</p>
<p>After enjoying reliable eggs, I moved on to meet a rare kind of friend, the <em>work friend</em>, Mo. To see them in the wild, in a new environment, to see how they wear clothes and talk and smile and laugh with me, it was a revelation. It brought me so much joy to share this time with her. Taking a chance at closeness made the trip to Mumbai worth it. Add in a work meeting, and I had a justified extravagance. Mo and I also met our ex-department head and another colleague. And it is with great pleasure that I announce, no they did not remember me. So I felt &quot;fuck it&quot; and left them with a memory of me recounting at least one Haryana centric female infanticide joke.</p>
<p>A surprising new learning was that I am not suited to meet English people, as I am brimming with colonialism jibes and remarks. They cannot even be called jokes. Certainly there was a real attempt at feeling guilt about such a behaviour, but like men on first dates, it is all inauthentic.</p>
<p>Mumbai opened my eyes to fashionable bags, which I saw everywhere. Within hours of reaching Mumbai, I was craving something that said &quot;Cavalli&quot; in bold letters.</p>
<h4>Work is worship lol</h4>

<p><a href=\"tab:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60410002-we-all-want-impossible-things\">We all want impossible things</a> was a meaningful book to read. It might seem too sad, the C (cancer) word is a premise, but essentially it is about two friends. As I only read it in public spaces, I could not escape tears. My throat was choked several times, and the traumatic meal from Popeye's Chicken was not the lone cause. The book did not resemble any kind of trauma porn. It was a beautiful, simple story that felt real and I was unsurprised to learn it was based on the author's own experiences.</p>
<p>No movies this week. Aren't I a rebel without a cause?</p>
<p>There is a fellow on Youtube who <a href=\"tab:https://www.youtube.com/@SittingHereReading\">reads books, by himself, on video</a>. No this is not a popular channel. No this is probably not making him any money. Yes it is shameful to think one would use these platforms only to profit.</p>
<p>The song Psycho Killer by Talking Heads was released in 1977. The <a href=\"tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ54eImz88w\">official video</a> was released four days ago. It is easy to relate to the video. Even I could find resemblance in a time where I cried out to Ru &quot;if I have to speak to a single client, I might stab myself in the eye&quot;. This song gets a mention as I have been recognising it whenever, wherever it plays, in film or tv. My recognition began with <a href=\"tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnVvBELqD3M\">this scene</a> in Mindhunter, a solid way to end an episode and declare the weight of all there is to come for these characters. So I thought to note a few notable mentions of this scenes that made me go &quot;its the song its the song!&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>During the <a href=\"tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl0w3c4QJRQ\">Son of Sam game</a> in season 2 of Only Murders in the Building. The OMITB opening track by Siddhartha Khosla is still my ringtone.</li>
<li>In Stranger Things season 4, when the high school jock character <a href=\"tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjlkWlVX14\">riles people up to fight for justice</a>, the score gives a perfect wink to who he could become.</li>
<li><a href=\"tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyE05Laf8Zg\">Damon Salvatore</a> in The Vampire Diaries, and it is a confusing moment for a young person (me) to see a sexy vampire (Damon) draining blood from another man (could be me?).</li>

(updated nil "2025-06-10T19:53:00+00:00") (author nil (name nil "avas") (email nil "hidden")) (content ((type . "html")) "<p>I wondered recently how I would romanticize<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> blogging, and if I actually already do. I took an (admittedly shorter than I anticipated) hiatus to come back when blogging calls me again, and during that time, I missed it and I read pieces by others that reminded me again what it means to me.</p>
<p>What came to mind first was the idealization of solitude. Self-reflection, keeping oneself occupied, and intentional space to think and sort your thoughts. Reminds me of the movie image of a character wearing headphones or typing away at a laptop on their own - they’re usually more shy, or a loner, mysterious, in thought, or going through something. They’re in their own head and don’t want to be approached and ripped out of their own thoughts.</p>
<p>I think making something pretty belongs to romanticizing something nowadays. If done at a desk, I think of making it cozy and maybe a little aesthetic. Tidying it up, getting a nice beverage, turning on fairy lights or lighting a candle. Preparing some snacks. Kind of like preparing for a study session, now that I think about it. You could imagine being the main character in some movie or music video - you’re Carrie Bradshaw or Andy Sachs typing away on your laptop.</p>
<p>There’s also the idea of a digital keepsake, a time capsule, a diary with more design opportunities and an audience. Feeling like being part of something bigger by doing something that may survive you, imagining how people will find it after your death. I imagine my blog like a heartshaped locket necklace and my blog posts are in the locket.</p>
<p>It’s also enabling us to romanticize other, unrelated aspects of life. A normal day becomes more special by shining the spotlight on a very small aspect of it and imbuing it with some meaning in a post. Something about the meal you cooked evolving into a story about your family home; posts feeling like you’re sending out a whisper into the forest and waiting to hear something back.</p>
<p>That led me to the actual topic: How would blogging fit into Romanticism<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\">2</a></sup>? Is blogging romantic in that sense?</p>
<p>Romanticism prioritized subjectivity and emotional authenticity over reason and objectivity. Blogging that’s personal and reflective (and not just how-to’s, portfolios or commercial) does this by offering a medium to express your inner life, thoughts, dreams, and struggles with a sort of intimacy and rawness that traditional publications and social media personalities lack. There’s a sort of “valorization”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\">3</a></sup> of the everyday and the mundane. Yes, technically you can find that all over the net via a million “Get Ready With Me” “What I Eat In A Day” “Outfit Of The Day” “What’s In My Bag”, but somehow those just feel performative, empty, consumerist. When people arrive on Bearblog and read the Discover section, many seem to comment how intimate and authentic the posts feel, enjoying reading mundane day reflections and week notes of others and connecting over it.</p>
<p>I also see a parallel between Romanticism as a reaction to industrialization, and (the return to) blogging as a reaction to mass media, the corporate internet, and homogenized social media platforms. Blogs often celebrate niche interests, alternative lifestyles, or personal struggles that resist the “flattening” of human experience into metrics and commodification via virality.</p>
<p>Then also, blogging in more minimalist ways (like Bearblog) without ads and popup banners and newsletter modals feels more organic, a kind of original expression not filtered through editorial constraints and SEO optimizations. To me, it could resemble the Romantic longing for authentic, unspoiled experience, for lost innocence, for nature, for the past and a return to the natural and the immediate. I recognize this whenever some people choose to talk about it in terms of <em>returning</em> to a simpler, older web and indulging in nostalgia, even in design.</p>
<p>What about the the Romantic ideal of the solitary (genius) artist that is misunderstood by society but in touch with deeper truths and their own feelings? That may be something some bloggers relate to: their role as observers, outsiders, or truth-tellers, writing outside the bounds of institutions (here: containerized social media), motivated by personal vision rather than profit, and unbound by popular taste. It ties back to what I said earlier about the idealization of solitude in the blogosphere.</p>
<p>Even the writing style and metaphors are a little romantic at times - “My little corner/nook of the web” “My quiet sanctuary” “My personal space” “Welcome to my digital garden” “From my heart to yours”; descriptions of a mind “wandering”, descriptions of pages of a website or blog as rooms, posts as letters. But especially when there is an emphasis on nature, landscapes, growth and plants :)</p>
<p>What’s blogging on the personal web within the indieweb, if not speaking your truth, resisting conformity, and making meaning through beauty, emotion, and imagination? All in the face of the alienating modernity of social media profiles and slick, impersonal websites for businesses?</p>
<p>But I would love to hear from you how you experience the sublime in blogging.</p>
<p>Speaking of romanticizing blogging, I had a little fun at the nail salon. Don't be mad at the nail tech; she really tried her best with the Bear kaomoji!</p>

"html")) "<p><em>—by a man who’s lived it</em></p>
<p>I’m trans. I’ve changed my body, my voice, my entire freaking life because not doing so would’ve eventually killed me. I didn’t choose this path to make a statement or escape misogyny. I chose it because I needed to survive. Because this is the only way I can exist and still be able to breathe.</p>
<p>But the version of “trans” I see celebrated online doesn’t look anything like the life I’ve built. What I see now is a word that’s been stretched beyond all recognition; used as an aesthetic, a non conforming political gesture. And the people who use it that way? They’ve never stared down the barrel of this identity the way I have.</p>
<p>Being trans, for me, is a risk. I have an invisible target tattoed on my back. It’s being clocked in public. It’s walking into a bathroom or changing room and preparing for confrontation. It’s feeling my heart rate spike every time a stranger’s eyes linger just a little <em>too</em> long. It’s the fear of losing my job, my home, my family, and any safety net I might have. If someone ever decides “you look wrong” it wouldn’t just mean a bad day, <strong>it could cost me my life.</strong></p>
<p>People who call themselves trans but <em>choose</em> to <em>never</em> transition socially, emotionally, physically or medically don’t carry that same weight. And I’m tired of pretending that’s not a huge difference in experience and meaning.</p>
<p>If you haven’t faced dysphoria…<br />
If you haven’t fought to change your body, your voice, your documents and your name, or how the world physically sees you…<br />
If you haven’t risked safety, comfort, or stability just to live a day as yourself…<br />
Then you’re not walking the same road I am.</p>
<p><em>And that’s not hate. That’s just fucking reality.</em></p>
<p>I don’t have anything against people who are questioning, exploring, or playing with gender. That’s their business. They’re free to do as they like, who am I to say they can’t or shouldn’t? But I refuse to let that version of “trans” erase mine. Because I’m not some aesthetic variation. I’m a binary man who has bled, cried, screamed, fought, and rebuilt himself. And when people like me try to speak? We’re silenced. Called transphobic or anti-woke. Told we’re gatekeeping and to be quiet while those who’ve never paid the price get to define the entire experience and speak for us. Speak over us.</p>
<p>There should be a word for what I am.<br />
And maybe it used to be “trans.”<br />
But I’m not sure anymore.</p>
<p>All I know is I didn’t get here by swapping out pronoun pins.</p>
<p>I got here by fighting tooth and nail, with a syringe and a vial.</p>

I think the &quot;do not split&quot; of America in 2025 is going to be the old and the young not splitting, so a certain extent.</p>
<p>The grandmas, where they show up (not the spicy zone downtown... elsewhere) are writing all sorts of stuff about social security and &quot;I believe in science&quot; on their signs, but they also love puerile insults. I cannot tell whether this indicates a generational difference in humor, but they absolutely love to call people chickens, and turds, and so on. We must embrace the puerile humor of the grandmas, I think.</p>
<p>I saw one older woman today who showed up with a huge cart full of pre-prepared signs. She just gave them to anyone who asked. There were organizers at the place where I was at, but they lost control of the crowd and the crowd took over four solid blocks of road and completely blocked traffic, and I saw the signs that lady passed around just sort of migrating up and down the road, and I doubt she got any of them back.

"html")) "<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The inspiration for this post came from a Reddit thread about <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Zig/comments/1jfr09h/question_about_releasesafe_performance/\">ReleaseSafe performance</a> in the Zig subreddit.</p>
<p>In that thread a user by the name AldoZeroun was asking why in Rust subreddit people are benchmarking similarly written code in Zig against Rust, but the Zig version was compiled in ReleaseSafe while Rust was compiled in the equivalent of ReleaseFast (opt-level=3 ~ the highest level of optimization in the Rust compiler).</p>
<h3>The argument for Zig in ReleaseSafe</h3>
<p>The author of the Rust subreddit thread (SaltyMaybe) mentioned ReleaseSafe in Zig is the most similar in terms of runtime safety checks: both have assertions, runtime bounds-checking and other safety checks. That sounds fine, no issues here.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/13/reddit_ReleaseSafe_00.png\" alt=\"reddit_ReleaseSafe_00\" /></p>
<h3>Digging deeper into the code</h3>
<p>We are getting to the interesting part where AldoZeroun got the time to rewrite Rust's crate memchr into Zig (let's call it ripmemchr ~ just like grep and ripgrep). Here's the link to the Rust <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1jfe73i/comment/mj4oh6y/?context=3\">subreddit thread</a>.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/13/reddit_ReleaseSafe_01.png\" alt=\"reddit_ReleaseSafe_01\" /></p>
<p>Key point in the highlighted part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;testing on ReleaseFast makes more sense given that almost all the memchr code I'm working from is written under the unsafe keyword, which means rust isn't doing bounds checking at runtime&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>'the memchr code is written under the ==unsafe== keyword'</strong> --&gt; an argument for compiling the Zig program in ReleaseFast instead of ReleaseSafe if the purpose is to make them as similar as possible.</p>
<p>Here's a different post from AldoZeroun on a similar tone but under the Zig subreddit thread:
<img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/13/reddit_ReleaseSafe_02.png\" alt=\"reddit_ReleaseSafe_02\" /></p>
<h3>Conclusion: so which compiler optimization option should we choose?</h3>
<p>In the case of writing Zig and Rust programs in order to be able to measure the equivalent / most similar compiler optimization, we need check which crates the Rust program is using and whether it's leveraging the unsafe keyword particularly in hotspots (unsafe has several functions, one of them is to provide extra speed boost).</p>
<p>Coz if they do, then ReleaseFast is more proper comparison and vice versa use ReleaseSafe if the program has no or at least minimal unsafe blocks. For me I'm using ReleaseSafe for compiling my Zig programs and -O2 optimization with lots of safety checks turned on for compiling C programs --&gt; this is because my Rust code are mostly fully safe Rust, unless I'm writing SIMD Rust which is full unsafe.</p>
<h3>Bonus: memchr(Rust) vs ripmemchr (Zig)</h3>
<p>Codes are taken from AldoZeroun's <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/qr_testing/benchmarking/zigvrust/-/tree/master/src?ref_type=heads\">gitlab repo</a>. Note: 2.5 months have passed between the day I first dig deep into this vs the writing of this blogpost, but looks like I just copy pasted AldoZeroun's Rust code while for the Zig code I did small modification, where I found Aldo's code is unnecessarily too long and verbose...so I modified the code to make it more compact while retaining functionality.</p>

<p>Many people who have moved to LA experience a phenomenon where relatives from other places will see outrageous claims about LA in the news and automatically believe them. It's a place that is very easy to lie about, partially because it is so enormous... and partially because &quot;LA is dangerous&quot; is one of those things people are willing to believe without evidence.</p>
<p>I'm not the first person to say this, but the things people are willing to believe without evidence always paint a super clear picture of their desires. Whose suffering are they hungry to see? Whose subjugation would make them happy? What simple and easy morality-play stories do they long to see acted out in the world around them?</p>
<p>The thing about mass protest, however, is that people mostly participate in it because it doesn't seem particularly dangerous to them. Sure, everyone knows things could go south... but when thousands and thousands of people my age - with lots to lose - show up at a protest, it's because the risk made sense to them.</p>
<p>I'm queuing this one up early on the evening of the 8th, all the way on the other side of the country, agitated that I can't be there or see any of this for myself. But I wanted to say: life is good in LA. People turn up in the thousands because they trust the other people turning up alongside them. There's nothing that could happen in this story that would make me scared to live there.</p>
<p>If you ever, ever ask me whether LA is too dangerous a place to live, I'll fucking hate you until you die. Your heart is a slime mold.</p>
<p>I have biked through a lot of LA in the middle of the night, which is an activity containing two separate ideas - LA at night and LA on a bike - that already make people say unhinged shit to me about this city and its safety. Add the fact that I'm <em>A Lady,</em> and you can probably imagine some of the shit that (often older, but not always) people will say to me about city life. But a whole day of anti-fascist protest is the kind of thing that makes me feel <em>safer</em> to live in a place like this.</p>

<h4>Frequency Illusion</h4>
<p>I'm sure you have!</p>
<p>It's been happening to me a lot lately; I don't try to find any meaning or pay too much attention to it, but I find it very amusing! It's like a fun little game.<br />
But I have to confess, sometimes a part of me tries to come up with meanings, or I act like I'm in the Matrix or something! Though I usually end up moving on very quickly after having fun for a bit.</p>
<p>My latest example of <em>Frequency Illusion</em>, aka the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon, was just a couple of days ago, when I decided to finally look up a manual for an old watch I have, which had been going off every night at around 12 am. The watch was in a box, in a room where it didn't bother anyone, but whenever I stayed up late to do things in said room, I could hear the alarm go off, three times, every five minutes, and then stop.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/skeleton/w-753-front.webp\" alt=\"W-753 - Front\" /></p>
<p>This went on for some months, and a week ago I decided it was time to do something, as I'm packing up my things for Japan, and having a watch with me could be useful, especially since I'm planning on replacing my current phone with a Japanese flip phone. I'm tired of smartphones. That reminds me, in the last couple of months I ended up &quot;acquiring&quot; 3 watches, despite never being a watch person, but that's a story for another post.</p>
<p>Where was I? Right, I had to look up the manual for my old watch; I had to know how to turn off the alarm and fix all the other settings.<br />
When I checked the model on the back, there I saw it:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/skeleton/w-753-back.webp\" alt=\"W-753 - Back\" /></p>
<p>For a little context, this watch was a gift from one of my grandparents, when I was a very young kid, just starting school, I believe? I probably wore it for two weeks before forgetting about it, and my mom ended up putting it away. Now, around 15 years later, I found it again, and the story I told you about happened.</p>
<p>So, where's the <em>Frequency Illusion</em>? Well, some years ago, like most guys in the world, I became a huge fan of Rome, everything Rome, and I still love Rome; I think about it every day, all the time! I hate how real the meme is...<br />
And one of the things I never forget about Rome is how it was founded on the 21st of April... <strong>753</strong> BC.<br />
One of my favorite dates, that I never forget and always think of, suddenly has a connection with my first watch, that I received as a gift over a decade and a half ago?<br />
Not only that, the watch is pretty good! Not very fashionable, or at least not my style, but it has a bunch of fun and useful features and modes.<br />
Feels like the kind of watch that you would wear during &quot;rough outdoor activities&quot;, like hiking, climbing a mountain, beach stuff... which... I'm gonna be doing in Japan?!</p>
<h4>What is going on?!</h4>
<p>Okay, see where I'm coming from?</p>
<p>I &quot;find&quot; an old watch, a gift from a grandparent that I love. I decide to tweak its settings after months of not paying attention to it, years if you're counting that. It is connected to one of the things I obsess over, because of the model number, and it's also gonna be super useful during this new chapter of my life in the Land of the Rising Sun?</p>

<h4>Frequency Illusion</h4>
<p>I'm sure you have!</p>
<p>It's been happening to me a lot lately; I don't try to find any meaning or pay too much attention to it, but I find it very amusing! It's like a fun little game.<br />
But I have to confess, sometimes a part of me tries to come up with meanings, or I act like I'm in the Matrix or something! Though I usually end up moving on very quickly after having fun for a bit.</p>
<p>My latest example of <em>Frequency Illusion</em>, aka the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon, was just a couple of days ago, when I decided to finally look up a manual for an old watch I have, which had been going off every night at around 12 am. The watch was in a box, in a room where it didn't bother anyone, but whenever I stayed up late to do things in said room, I could hear the alarm go off, three times, every five minutes, and then stop.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/skeleton/w-753-front.webp\" alt=\"W-753 - Front\" /></p>
<p>This went on for some months, and a week ago I decided it was time to do something, as I'm packing up my things for Japan, and having a watch with me could be useful, especially since I'm planning on replacing my current phone with a Japanese flip phone. I'm tired of smartphones. That reminds me, in the last couple of months I ended up &quot;acquiring&quot; 3 watches, despite never being a watch person, but that's a story for another post.</p>
<p>Where was I? Right, I had to look up the manual for my old watch; I had to know how to turn off the alarm and fix all the other settings.<br />
When I checked the model on the back, there I saw it:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/skeleton/w-753-back.webp\" alt=\"W-753 - Back\" /></p>
<p>For a little context, this watch was a gift from one of my grandparents, when I was a very young kid, just starting school, I believe? I probably wore it for two weeks before forgetting about it, and my mom ended up putting it away. Now, around 15 years later, I found it again, and the story I told you about happened.</p>

Today I wanna talk about <a href=\"https://forkingmad.blog/i-want-to-comment-on-your-blog-post/\">this blogpost</a> made by forking mad that advocates for adding comment sections to your blog.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the comment section is probably the single worst thing to have ever happened to online discussion.</p>
<p>I don't mind if you add one to your blog - you do you.
I just really don't like them and will do my best not to use them if i can.</p>
<p>Lemme explain.</p>
<p>First of all:</p>
<h2>No. I don't want to make an account just to comment on your blog.</h2>
<p>And I don't want my replies to things to be scattered across twenty different indieweb services. Believe it or not, but when I write something I would like to be able to still find and read that a month, two years, or even 10 to 20 years in the future. I want to have <em>some</em> kind of reassurance that when I communicate with you I will have records of that that last and are easily accessible in one place.</p>
<p>I trust herman to keep bearblog around for a while. And I can export all of my bearblog data and back it up somewhere else. I can't do that with most comment sections, at least not easily. And I don't trust every comment section provider to be around forever or to not wipe my comments. I don't want to have blind faith in the uptime of the 25 different comment services people use.</p>
<p>Second:</p>
<h2>They're probably the worst medium for communication.</h2>
<p>Comment sections make it very easy to comment on stuff. That is the problem. Part of the reason discussion on bearblog is fairly civil compared to most other social media is the fact that there's no comments on most blogs. When you want to make a response you have to either email the person or write a response post. That small barrier to entry cuts out most idiots. Because you have to actually <em>care</em> about what you have to say to sit down and write an email or to make an entire response post. You have to put in <em>some</em> effort. And I think that that's generally condusive to online discussion. Because it means the people that read the first five sentences or just the headline of your post and then get mad and write something stupid can no longer do that. You don't get that completely meaningless drivel you get on, say, youtube. And if you just want to say &quot;good job&quot;, you can absolutely do that. I'd say it's <em>more</em> meaningful in the form of an email or response post. Because it shows you cared enough to put in some effort to deliver that message. If you just kind of enjoyed a blogpost and want to show appreciation, there's the toast button. If you want to offer any deeper criticism or express your appreciation in a more nuanced way, write an email or make a response post.</p>
<p>Sure, you might say: Oh, just delete the stupid comments. I guess, you can do that, but the problem is that the format <em>encourages</em> that sort of interaction. People generally tend to be more terse and less thourough in what they write. Because, well:
They don't know what your comment section allows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does it remove comments with <em>any</em> links?</li>
<li>Does it just remove comments that have a lot of links?</li>
<li>Does it remove comments with swear words?</li>
<li>Does it remove comments from people with &quot;untrustworthy&quot; email hosts?</li>
<li>Will it just throw an error if i submit my comment? I have no clue if the people running it are at all competent.</li>
<li>Does it have an upper character limit? If yes, will it tell me or just throw the comment away silently?</li>
</ol>
<p>So, you generally play it safe. You don't cite sources, you use safe language, you write small comments.
At least I do. Because I don't know if the people running your comment section have any idea what they're doing, and how much they allow. My response blogposts are essentially just comments. These are the kinds of comments i posted on social media before i started writing blogposts. Does your commenting service allow for comments this long? And there's that sort of implicit assumption that comments are temporary. They're not made to last, so people write them like they're not made to last. They just tend to say whatever and move on. It's a format that encourages short quips, trite jokes and &quot;gotcha moments&quot; and discourages people genuinely engaging with a topic.</p>
<p>Third:</p>
<h2>They have horrible UX</h2>
<p>Comment sections encourage just shouting into the void.
As I just said, they're a terrible medium for communication. Let's say I give you some feedback about your post via your comment section and you respond.</p>
<p>Here's some scenarios for how that could play out:</p>
<p>The comment service doesn't have email notifications:
I don't ever see your comment, nothing happens.</p>
<p>It does have email notifications but I misspelled my email:
Also nothing happens - In contrast, email clients usually tell you when the email you're trying to send to doesn't exist. And obviously, the email you're sending from would be correct.</p>
<p>I spelled my email correct and get the notification:<br />
Now I have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open my Notes app, because I have yet to see a comment section that saves your comment draft so it doesnt disappear when you accidentally refresh (this has happened to me enough times on mobile to have probably stolen a couple hours of off my lifespan. I write long comments.)</li>
<li>Copy my comment from the notes app</li>
<li>Open the email app again and click on your link</li>
<li>Finally paste in my comment</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;Oh, but what If you can just reply via email and it appears in the comment section&quot; - Congratulations, you have reinvented the concept of a mailing list. Go become a kernel.org contributor or something. Also I haven't heard of any comment section that actually does this.</p>
<p>Fourth:</p>
<h2>There's no situation where they are the ideal form of communication.</h2>
<p>If I want to talk to you privately, i send you an email. Comments are public, so that's obviously not a use-case here.</p>
<p>If I want to talk to you publicly, I make a response post. People not on your blog will also be able to see that in bearblog discovery - When I respond to something publicly, i generally want it to be seen.</p>
<p>If I want to talk to you publicly, but not so publicly that lots of people end up seeing it, I make it so the blogpost doesn't show up on bearblog discover. You can still see it in your analytics if i link to you. It's on my blog, which is the canonical representation on all the stuff i post publicly online, and is a place that <em>I</em> control. Not some tech startup.</p>
<p>If I care enough to want to respond publicly but don't care enough for it to be worth making a blogpost, then I <em>guess</em> it would be optimal? But I don't think that's a situation anyone has ever been in. Making a blogpost isn't <em>that</em> hard compared to just commenting.</p>
<p>Firth:</p>
<h2>Does your comments host care about my rights?</h2>
<p>I don't know. I don't want to read the TOS to find out. For example, komments.cloud &quot;conditions of use&quot; say:</p>
<p>&quot;you relinquish all ownership of the content of the comment, beyond being credited for writing it.&quot;<br />
I would like to own the things i write, thank you very much.<br />
I don't have the time or energy to look this up for every commenting service.</p>
<p>I also don't know if your commenting service lets me easily delete all my comments.</p>
<p>Maybe, at some point, I realize that I want all my data to be gone off of that service. Maybe they did something terrible. Maybe I just felt like doing it. Maybe it's some mysterious third reason. Under EU law, it is my right to be able to do that, but often big (and small) tech companies just don't respect it, and I certainly do not have the time or money to be able to get a lawyer involved in those cases.</p>
<p>Bearblog has a &quot;delete my blog&quot; button that deletes my blog and all the stuff i made. Does your commenting service? No guarantee. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. Who knows. I'm alright with this when it comes to email because there's not one big entity that controls all of my emails. There's my email provider, sure, but I only have to do research <em>once</em> on whether or not I can delete my account there, and not every time i send an email to a different person.</p>
<p>It's kind of inherent to the format that you can't delete your mails from other peoples inboxes. Emails aren't public, and they're not controlled by one entity and are an open standard, so I'm far more comfortable with not being able to delete stuff i send over there. A commenting service is none of those things. According to komments.cloud's privacy policy they will let me delete my account, but I do not want to have to read a privacy policy every time i want to comment on a site that uses a different service. And privacy policies and enforcement of those policies can change. I do not want to have to keep track of this.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I left regular social media for bearblog precisely <em>because</em> it doesn't have comment sections. I don't mind if anyone adds one to their blog - they can obviously do that - but I don't think they should be on <em>every</em> blog. I certainly won't ever add one to mine.

"html")) "<p>Heya! Kami here.
Today I wanna talk about <a href=\"https://forkingmad.blog/i-want-to-comment-on-your-blog-post/\">this blogpost</a> made by forking mad that advocates for adding comment sections to your blog.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the comment section is probably the single worst thing to have ever happened to online discussion.</p>
<p>I don't mind if you add one to your blog - you do you.
I just really don't like them and will do my best not to use them if i can.</p>
<p>Lemme explain.</p>
<p>First of all:</p>
<h2>No. I don't want to make an account just to comment on your blog.</h2>
<p>And I don't want my replies to things to be scattered across twenty different indieweb services. Believe it or not, but when I write something I would like to be able to still find and read that a month, two years, or even 10 to 20 years in the future. I want to have <em>some</em> kind of reassurance that when I communicate with you I will have records of that that last and are easily accessible in one place.</p>
<p>I trust herman to keep bearblog around for a while. And I can export all of my bearblog data and back it up somewhere else. I can't do that with most comment sections, at least not easily. And I don't trust every comment section provider to be around forever or to not wipe my comments. I don't want to have blind faith in the uptime of the 25 different comment services people use.</p>
<p>Second:</p>
<h2>They're probably the worst medium for communication.</h2>
<p>Comment sections make it very easy to comment on stuff. That is the problem. Part of the reason discussion on bearblog is fairly civil compared to most other social media is the fact that there's no comments on most blogs. When you want to make a response you have to either email the person or write a response post. That small barrier to entry cuts out most idiots. Because you have to actually <em>care</em> about what you have to say to sit down and write an email or to make an entire response post. You have to put in <em>some</em> effort. And I think that that's generally condusive to online discussion. Because it means the people that read the first five sentences or just the headline of your post and then get mad and write something stupid can no longer do that. You don't get that completely meaningless drivel you get on, say, youtube. And if you just want to say &quot;good job&quot;, you can absolutely do that. I'd say it's <em>more</em> meaningful in the form of an email or response post. Because it shows you cared enough to put in some effort to deliver that message. If you just kind of enjoyed a blogpost and want to show appreciation, there's the toast button. If you want to offer any deeper criticism or express your appreciation in a more nuanced way, write an email or make a response post.</p>
<p>Sure, you might say: Oh, just delete the stupid comments. I guess, you can do that, but the problem is that the format <em>encourages</em> that sort of interaction. People generally tend to be more terse and less thourough in what they write. Because, well:
They don't know what your comment section allows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does it remove comments with <em>any</em> links?</li>
<li>Does it just remove comments that have a lot of links?</li>
<li>Does it remove comments with swear words?</li>
<li>Does it remove comments from people with &quot;untrustworthy&quot; email hosts?</li>
<li>Will it just throw an error if i submit my comment? I have no clue if the people running it are at all competent.</li>
<li>Does it have an upper character limit? If yes, will it tell me or just throw the comment away silently?</li>
</ol>
<p>So, you generally play it safe. You don't cite sources, you use safe language, you write small comments.
At least I do. Because I don't know if the people running your comment section have any idea what they're doing, and how much they allow. My response blogposts are essentially just comments. These are the kinds of comments i posted on social media before i started writing blogposts. Does your commenting service allow for comments this long? And there's that sort of implicit assumption that comments are temporary. They're not made to last, so people write them like they're not made to last. They just tend to say whatever and move on. It's a format that encourages short quips, trite jokes and &quot;gotcha moments&quot; and discourages people genuinely engaging with a topic.</p>
<p>Third:</p>
<h2>They have horrible UX</h2>
<p>Comment sections encourage just shouting into the void.
As I just said, they're a terrible medium for communication. Let's say I give you some feedback about your post via your comment section and you respond.</p>
<p>Here's some scenarios for how that could play out:</p>
<p>The comment service doesn't have email notifications:
I don't ever see your comment, nothing happens.</p>
<p>It does have email notifications but I misspelled my email:
Also nothing happens - In contrast, email clients usually tell you when the email you're trying to send to doesn't exist. And obviously, the email you're sending from would be correct.</p>
<p>I spelled my email correct and get the notification:<br />
Now I have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open my Notes app, because I have yet to see a comment section that saves your comment draft so it doesnt disappear when you accidentally refresh (this has happened to me enough times on mobile to have probably stolen a couple hours of off my lifespan. I write long comments.)</li>
<li>Copy my comment from the notes app</li>
<li>Open the email app again and click on your link</li>
<li>Finally paste in my comment</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;Oh, but what If you can just reply via email and it appears in the comment section&quot; - Congratulations, you have reinvented the concept of a mailing list. Go become a kernel.org contributor or something. Also I haven't heard of any comment section that actually does this.</p>
<p>Fourth:</p>
<h2>There's no situation where they are the ideal form of communication.</h2>
<p>If I want to talk to you privately, i send you an email. Comments are public, so that's obviously not a use-case here.</p>
<p>If I want to talk to you publicly, I make a response post. People not on your blog will also be able to see that in bearblog discovery - When I respond to something publicly, i generally want it to be seen.</p>
<p>If I want to talk to you publicly, but not so publicly that lots of people end up seeing it, I make it so the blogpost doesn't show up on bearblog discover. You can still see it in your analytics if i link to you. It's on my blog, which is the canonical representation on all the stuff i post publicly online, and is a place that <em>I</em> control. Not some tech startup.</p>
<p>If I care enough to want to respond publicly but don't care enough for it to be worth making a blogpost, then I <em>guess</em> it would be optimal? But I don't think that's a situation anyone has ever been in. Making a blogpost isn't <em>that</em> hard compared to just commenting.</p>
<p>Firth:</p>
<h2>Does your comments host care about my rights?</h2>
<p>I don't know. I don't want to read the TOS to find out. For example, komments.cloud &quot;conditions of use&quot; say:</p>
<p>&quot;you relinquish all ownership of the content of the comment, beyond being credited for writing it.&quot;<br />
I would like to own the things i write, thank you very much.<br />
I don't have the time or energy to look this up for every commenting service.</p>
<p>I also don't know if your commenting service lets me easily delete all my comments.</p>
<p>Maybe, at some point, I realize that I want all my data to be gone off of that service. Maybe they did something terrible. Maybe I just felt like doing it. Maybe it's some mysterious third reason. Under EU law, it is my right to be able to do that, but often big (and small) tech companies just don't respect it, and I certainly do not have the time or money to be able to get a lawyer involved in those cases.</p>
<p>Bearblog has a &quot;delete my blog&quot; button that deletes my blog and all the stuff i made. Does your commenting service? No guarantee. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. Who knows. I'm alright with this when it comes to email because there's not one big entity that controls all of my emails. There's my email provider, sure, but I only have to do research <em>once</em> on whether or not I can delete my account there, and not every time i send an email to a different person.</p>
<p>It's kind of inherent to the format that you can't delete your mails from other peoples inboxes. Emails aren't public, and they're not controlled by one entity and are an open standard, so I'm far more comfortable with not being able to delete stuff i send over there. A commenting service is none of those things. According to komments.cloud's privacy policy they will let me delete my account, but I do not want to have to read a privacy policy every time i want to comment on a site that uses a different service. And privacy policies and enforcement of those policies can change. I do not want to have to keep track of this.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I left regular social media for bearblog precisely <em>because</em> it doesn't have comment sections. I don't mind if anyone adds one to their blog - they can obviously do that - but I don't think they should be on <em>every</em> blog. I certainly won't ever add one to mine. This isn't because I don't care about what other people have to say; it is precisely because I <em>do care</em> that I hate comment sections. If someone has something to say to me, they should make a response post or email me. Or, I don't know, stalk me on the internet to figure out where I live and then send me a carrier pidgeon. That would still be a more effective way to communicate.</p>

"<p>I watched someone practice guitar in a living room last weekend, windows wide open to the street. They'd been playing for three months and sounded exactly like someone who'd been playing for three months — which is to say, terrible. The neighbors could hear every missed chord, every fumbled transition, every moment where the music stopped and started again like a car that wouldn't turn over. The guitarist didn't care. They were too busy learning.</p>
<p>Here's what stopped me cold — this person had solved a problem I didn't even know I had. Years ago, I used to record voice memos in my closet like some kind of audio vampire, terrified my half-formed thoughts might escape into daylight. They'd simply opened the windows and gotten on with the business of being bad at something.</p>
<p>This is the thing about embarrassment — we think it's protecting us from something real, but mostly it's protecting us from something we made up. We've constructed this elaborate theater where other people are the audience and we are forever auditioning for a role we don't even want. The part of flawless &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot;, who struts out of the womb fully competent, ready to deliver a TED Talk on life mastery, never had to learn anything, never struggles, never fumbles, never has to start over, never looked stupid while figuring it out.</p>
<p>Someone once told me that the biggest barrier to growth isn't lack of talent or opportunity — it's the fear of being witnessed in our incompetence. They weren't talking about a character flaw. They were naming the fundamental choice between performance and transformation. You can spend your whole life perfecting what you already know, or you can step into the territory where you don't know anything yet. The territory where you look exactly like what you are: a novice.</p>
<p>Most of us choose performance. We write our novels in secret. We start businesses we never tell anyone about until they're already successful. We practice our skills in private until we're good enough to not look foolish. We think this is maturity, but it's actually a sophisticated form of hiding.</p>
<p>The problem isn't just that we miss out on feedback, though we do. The problem is that we never <a href=\"https://prickly.oxhe.art/\">develop the capacity to exist in the space between stories</a> — between where we are and where we're going. We never learn to be comfortable being uncomfortable while other people watch. We stay small not because we lack ambition, but because we lack the tolerance for being seen in our unfinished state.</p>
<p>I think about the writers whose novels live forever in drawers, waiting to be &quot;good enough&quot;. The entrepreneurs whose brilliant ideas die in the safety of never being tested. The people who suffer alone rather than ask for help, because asking means admitting they don't have it figured out. They're all protecting the same precious, impossible thing — the illusion that competence comes before action, that we transform in private and then unveil ourselves, fully formed.</p>
<p>But that's not how anything works. Not change, not learning, not belonging. We become ourselves in relationship to other people's eyes, other people's feedback, other people's witness to our stumbling. The embarrassment isn't the enemy of the process — it's the system working exactly as designed.</p>
<p>When we're embarrassed, we're in the exact place where growth lives. We're pushing against the edges of who we think we are. We're discovering that our self-image is smaller than our actual capacity. The discomfort isn't telling us we're doing something wrong; it's telling us we're doing something new.</p>
<p>This requires a different relationship with failure, with looking foolish, with being seen before we're ready. It requires understanding that the person who has it all together is also the person who has stopped growing. That polished competence and active learning are actually incompatible states.</p>
<p>The fear of embarrassment masquerades as concern about other people's judgment, but it's really about our own <a href=\"https://prickly.oxhe.art/coachability/\">attachment to being someone who doesn't need help</a>, doesn't make mistakes, doesn't have to start over. It's about the violence we do to ourselves when we insist on being experts and refuse to be beginners.</p>
<p>When you stop protecting that image, you start to discover what you're actually capable of. Not the safe, manageable version of your capabilities, but the true ones — the kind that emerge when you're willing to be awkward, to ask stupid questions, to try things you might fail at.</p>
<p>The people who grow fastest aren't the most talented. They're the ones who can tolerate being witnessed in their incompetence — the ones who can stumble publicly and somehow make it look intentional. They've made peace with the gap between their vision and their current skill level. They've learned that embarrassment isn't just the price you pay for growth — it's the cover charge for <a href=\"https://prickly.oxhe.art/before-allowed/\">entering any room worth being in</a>.</p>

Me, but as a familiar stranger. Separated by over 8000 kilometers, my sister and I have known of each other's existences for a decade. Only a few days ago did we finally reunite.</p>
<p>We met in an unfamiliar country that I never expected to host our reunion. Kazakhstan is similar enough to Russia though and is cool in its own way, of course.</p>
<p>It was actually less emotional than expected. I thought at least one of us would cry when we first met, but not a single tear was shed. The first moments of meeting were awkward. Again, no tears, but all I could do in the moment was ask how she is doing even though I already knew the answer to that question. She asked for permission to hug me. Why didn't I think of doing that in the first place?</p>
<p>Despite our similarities, I immediately thought we looked more different than photos made us out to be. We have the same eye color, but her eyes are rounder than mine just like her face. We've made quite different choices with our lips and eyebrows. She's skinny, almost frail, perhaps due to coping with work- and marriage-related stressors that made her cut her time with me short from about a week to merely 2.5 days.</p>
<p>Whenever I ask her, she thinks she looks like neither our mother nor our father. More like her maternal grandmother. I think she doesn't want to admit the truth: that she looks very much like our father who, to put it lightly, treated our mother like shit, got into alcohol, wanted nothing to do with my sister and saw her all of two times, and threatened to leave her mother if she kept me. Our mother chose neither of us, raising my sister alone briefly before finding a new partner and having a son with him. I look more like our mother. Interesting that we look like the respective parent who abandoned us.</p>
<p>Though of course, I cannot lie: among other similarities, it was comforting to see someone with the same eye color as me even though she said mine are grayer than hers. In terms of appearance, there are probably just as many commonalities as there are differences. As she is less than 11 months older than me, I wondered if people looked at us and thought we're fraternal twins.</p>
<p>At the same time, I couldn't help but feel like I was getting a taste of my own medicine. Our temperaments are too similar. I could only shake my head when she repeatedly refused to let me cover the full price of less than $4 for a taxi ride that both of us needed to take. Yet for some reason she insisted on paying for my ride on the metro. So, I guess the money thing worked only one way.</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes almost out of their sockets when I received text messages from her prefaced with the phrase &quot;if we see each other tomorrow . . .&quot; as if I weren't the one to initiate our reunion in the first place, fly to the other side of the world, learn my birth language so I can competently communicate with her in person, and gift a photo album with dozens of photos documenting my life for her and her family. Why wouldn't we see each other as long as we are both in the same city? My friends say it's like fighting tooth and nail to get me to accept even the smallest amount of help, but I like to think I'm not as stubborn as my sister.</p>
<p>Then she asked if she's supposed to return the photo album to me after I specified initially that it's for her.</p>
<p>But maybe it was something to do with me. Was I being cold? Something is wrong with me, perhaps, having been rejected from my birth family and birth country and denigrated by my adoptive family for my whole adolescence. All that can't be a coincidence.</p>
<p>As I detailed earlier, I don't know how to be a sister. Maybe I don't even know how to be a human being. After all, human beings are fundamentally connected to other human beings. I, however. am untethered, and it's easy for me to stay that way as I can break ties with another person like ripping off a bandaid.</p>
<p>Every day I had to fight the compulsion to shy away and give both of us space as she inched so close to me to look down at the map I used to navigate ourselves around Almaty that I felt her hair brush against my forehead. I don't even really come that close to my best friends after years of contact. Maybe unfamiliar blood relatives are granted special permissions from the git-go and no one told me.</p>
<p>Later, a small pack of stray dogs came howling and barreling down the top of a quiet street we were exploring. We both immediately froze. Until my sister grabbed my hand for dear life, insisting she doesn't fear dogs but still demanding me to be quiet and pulling me along with her. I'll admit they intimidated me a little, too. I didn't grab her hand back though. Instead I let my hand, the size of a nine-year-old's, hang limp in my sister's grasp. For some reason her hands are normally sized.</p>
<p>For the first 1.5 days I felt bad that I didn't feel as much as I was &quot;supposed to,&quot; an amount that is surely unquantifiable but something that my brain still wants to be tangible. Things were going well, and it was no surprise that they were given our similar personalities and interests. We walked more than planned, but she didn't complain much. I walk fast according to her. We talked when we both wanted to talk, and we naturally fell silent as we coincidentally started feeling bad or tired at the same time. We were in sync.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was awkward, and this person -- my blood relative, the first one I ever met, and the only one born from the same mother and father as me -- who voluntarily flew to see me felt like a distant friend from elementary school. Attached at the hip all day until we retreated to our separate accommodations, where we could recount our impressions to the members of our polar opposite worlds.</p>
<p>I felt there was some sort of power dynamic, even though she may not have, or, if so, in the opposite direction. For me, it was not just because she is older and more experienced in some ways, already with a soon-to-be ex-husband and the owner of two small businesses. Rather it was more about me, the rejected sibling, here to hang out with the one who was kept. And I was the one to request this. As much as she emphasized how lost she feels in her life as a result of the situation, maybe I'm the needier one.</p>
<p>Plus, I had to cope with all this in my third language. It wasn't hard necessarily because I am still learning Russian. But every moment of success after expressing a complex thought and realizing that I was speaking more or less at ease with my sister -- something unimaginable five years ago as I stumbled through Duolingo -- was accompanied by perpetual unworthiness that comes with trying to prove yourself in the language of the country that as a whole rejected you. Before the trip, she bought a course in English so that we could speak in my language, too. We ended up speaking Russian only. I expected that though.</p>
<p>Thankfully, things improved. Eventually she opened up and shared some of the things that were previously left to my imagination via text, instead promised to be explained in person. Just as I felt my brain on the verge of imploding after speaking in Russian for a number of hours that would surely exhaust me even in my native language, some sort of bond started to form. Maybe it was the pressure of our meeting approaching a close that was able to bring out the topics that brought us to Kazakhstan in the first place; otherwise, I think our mutual tendencies for avoidance would have continued to sweep them under the rug in favor of small talk.</p>
<p>I found myself often feeling bad for her, though it's clear that she has a strong psyche and there is no way I can really help her anyway. I pitied her so easily, and it was unsettling in a way that made me genuinely wonder if I am too hard on my own self.</p>
<p>On Friday we went to the airport very late at night for her flight at 4:30 AM. I stayed with her until nearly 2 AM until my accommodation for my remaining days in Almaty summoned me for sleep. While saying goodbye, she admitted the time was too short. She hopes we see each other in another country again someday. I have this same desire. Still, I wasn't sure if she was saying that to be nice (an American thing, but who knows) and maybe she didn't like me as much as expected. Or at all. This time, I initiated the hug. And that was all. Goodbye until whenever.</p>
<p>I don't know what to make of it. It went well, but I don't believe it actually happened. More emotions will almost certainly surface after I exit vacation mode. I'm torn: On the one hand, perhaps I am actually much stronger and was even overprepared for our reunion. Or maybe I am so weak that I didn't open up enough out of fear.</p>
<p>In any case, I think we walked away with a better understanding of ourselves and each other. I can only hope that the experience alleviated at least a morsel of the shame my sister feels surrounding her family for a &quot;choice&quot; only her mother could make that in reality was more of an obligation thanks to what unraveled from the breakup of the Soviet Union and a shitty relationship. I don't blame her, but my sister does. And herself.</p>
<p>I'm walking around Almaty feeling lighter than before, likely thanks to seeing myself in someone else for the first time. A privilege that most take for granted. I feel a little less like an alien, for whatever that's worth.

"html")) "<p>This weekend I said goodbye to an alternative version of me. Me, but as a familiar stranger. Separated by over 8000 kilometers, my sister and I have known of each other's existences for a decade. Only a few days ago did we finally reunite.</p>
<p>We met in an unfamiliar country that I never expected to host our reunion. Kazakhstan is similar enough to Russia though and is cool in its own way, of course.</p>
<p>It was actually less emotional than expected. I thought at least one of us would cry when we first met, but not a single tear was shed. The first moments of meeting were awkward. Again, no tears, but all I could do in the moment was ask how she is doing even though I already knew the answer to that question. She asked for permission to hug me. Why didn't I think of doing that in the first place?</p>
<p>Despite our similarities, I immediately thought we looked more different than photos made us out to be. We have the same eye color, but her eyes are rounder than mine just like her face. We've made quite different choices with our lips and eyebrows. She's skinny, almost frail, perhaps due to coping with work- and marriage-related stressors that made her cut her time with me short from about a week to merely 2.5 days.</p>
<p>Whenever I ask her, she thinks she looks like neither our mother nor our father. More like her maternal grandmother. I think she doesn't want to admit the truth: that she looks very much like our father who, to put it lightly, treated our mother like shit, got into alcohol, wanted nothing to do with my sister and saw her all of two times, and threatened to leave her mother if she kept me. Our mother chose neither of us, raising my sister alone briefly before finding a new partner and having a son with him. I look more like our mother. Interesting that we look like the respective parent who abandoned us.</p>
<p>Though of course, I cannot lie: among other similarities, it was comforting to see someone with the same eye color as me even though she said mine are grayer than hers. In terms of appearance, there are probably just as many commonalities as there are differences. As she is less than 11 months older than me, I wondered if people looked at us and thought we're fraternal twins.</p>
<p>At the same time, I couldn't help but feel like I was getting a taste of my own medicine. Our temperaments are too similar. I could only shake my head when she repeatedly refused to let me cover the full price of less than $4 for a taxi ride that both of us needed to take. Yet for some reason she insisted on paying for my ride on the metro. So, I guess the money thing worked only one way.</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes almost out of their sockets when I received text messages from her prefaced with the phrase &quot;if we see each other tomorrow . . .&quot; as if I weren't the one to initiate our reunion in the first place, fly to the other side of the world, learn my birth language so I can competently communicate with her in person, and gift a photo album with dozens of photos documenting my life for her and her family. Why wouldn't we see each other as long as we are both in the same city? My friends say it's like fighting tooth and nail to get me to accept even the smallest amount of help, but I like to think I'm not as stubborn as my sister.</p>
<p>Then she asked if she's supposed to return the photo album to me after I specified initially that it's for her.</p>
<p>But maybe it was something to do with me. Was I being cold? Something is wrong with me, perhaps, having been rejected from my birth family and birth country and denigrated by my adoptive family for my whole adolescence. All that can't be a coincidence.</p>
<p>As I detailed earlier, I don't know how to be a sister. Maybe I don't even know how to be a human being. After all, human beings are fundamentally connected to other human beings. I, however. am untethered, and it's easy for me to stay that way as I can break ties with another person like ripping off a bandaid.</p>
<p>Every day I had to fight the compulsion to shy away and give both of us space as she inched so close to me to look down at the map I used to navigate ourselves around Almaty that I felt her hair brush against my forehead. I don't even really come that close to my best friends after years of contact. Maybe unfamiliar blood relatives are granted special permissions from the git-go and no one told me.</p>
<p>Later, a small pack of stray dogs came howling and barreling down the top of a quiet street we were exploring. We both immediately froze. Until my sister grabbed my hand for dear life, insisting she doesn't fear dogs but still demanding me to be quiet and pulling me along with her. I'll admit they intimidated me a little, too. I didn't grab her hand back though. Instead I let my hand, the size of a nine-year-old's, hang limp in my sister's grasp. For some reason her hands are normally sized.</p>
<p>For the first 1.5 days I felt bad that I didn't feel as much as I was &quot;supposed to,&quot; an amount that is surely unquantifiable but something that my brain still wants to be tangible. Things were going well, and it was no surprise that they were given our similar personalities and interests. We walked more than planned, but she didn't complain much. I walk fast according to her. We talked when we both wanted to talk, and we naturally fell silent as we coincidentally started feeling bad or tired at the same time. We were in sync.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was awkward, and this person -- my blood relative, the first one I ever met, and the only one born from the same mother and father as me -- who voluntarily flew to see me felt like a distant friend from elementary school. Attached at the hip all day until we retreated to our separate accommodations, where we could recount our impressions to the members of our polar opposite worlds.</p>
<p>I felt there was some sort of power dynamic, even though she may not have, or, if so, in the opposite direction. For me, it was not just because she is older and more experienced in some ways, already with a soon-to-be ex-husband and the owner of two small businesses. Rather it was more about me, the rejected sibling, here to hang out with the one who was kept. And I was the one to request this. As much as she emphasized how lost she feels in her life as a result of the situation, maybe I'm the needier one.</p>
<p>Plus, I had to cope with all this in my third language. It wasn't hard necessarily because I am still learning Russian. But every moment of success after expressing a complex thought and realizing that I was speaking more or less at ease with my sister -- something unimaginable five years ago as I stumbled through Duolingo -- was accompanied by perpetual unworthiness that comes with trying to prove yourself in the language of the country that as a whole rejected you. Before the trip, she bought a course in English so that we could speak in my language, too. We ended up speaking Russian only. I expected that though.</p>
<p>Thankfully, things improved. Eventually she opened up and shared some of the things that were previously left to my imagination via text, instead promised to be explained in person. Just as I felt my brain on the verge of imploding after speaking in Russian for a number of hours that would surely exhaust me even in my native language, some sort of bond started to form. Maybe it was the pressure of our meeting approaching a close that was able to bring out the topics that brought us to Kazakhstan in the first place; otherwise, I think our mutual tendencies for avoidance would have continued to sweep them under the rug in favor of small talk.</p>
<p>I found myself often feeling bad for her, though it's clear that she has a strong psyche and there is no way I can really help her anyway. I pitied her so easily, and it was unsettling in a way that made me genuinely wonder if I am too hard on my own self.</p>
<p>On Friday we went to the airport very late at night for her flight at 4:30 AM. I stayed with her until nearly 2 AM until my accommodation for my remaining days in Almaty summoned me for sleep. While saying goodbye, she admitted the time was too short. She hopes we see each other in another country again someday. I have this same desire. Still, I wasn't sure if she was saying that to be nice (an American thing, but who knows) and maybe she didn't like me as much as expected. Or at all. This time, I initiated the hug. And that was all. Goodbye until whenever.</p>
<p>I don't know what to make of it. It went well, but I don't believe it actually happened. More emotions will almost certainly surface after I exit vacation mode. I'm torn: On the one hand, perhaps I am actually much stronger and was even overprepared for our reunion. Or maybe I am so weak that I didn't open up enough out of fear.</p>
<p>In any case, I think we walked away with a better understanding of ourselves and each other. I can only hope that the experience alleviated at least a morsel of the shame my sister feels surrounding her family for a &quot;choice&quot; only her mother could make that in reality was more of an obligation thanks to what unraveled from the breakup of the Soviet Union and a shitty relationship. I don't blame her, but my sister does. And herself.</p>
<p>I'm walking around Almaty feeling lighter than before, likely thanks to seeing myself in someone else for the first time. A privilege that most take for granted. I feel a little less like an alien, for whatever that's worth. And while I doubt I will ever fully recover from my adoption, I made a big step in a matter of days that even quality therapy, though helpful, could not touch for years.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, it feels like a new beginning rather than a resolution to many years of disillusionment, shame, and longing. Not necessarily just with my birth family, though I am nervous to see what will become of our contact. I wonder what she's told her mom, stepfather, and brother about me. Did I meet expectations? Fall short?</p>

<h3>Rewrite the C++ code to C</h3>
<p>I rewrote Dmitry's C++ code to C:</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>At the end of the conversation Dmitry mentioned that he specifically crafted this example to trick dynamic analysis for C++. I'm a big fan of Dmitry's work and I will dig deeper into his blog and UB-book for the next part of this series. I still fully expect I would get absolutely trashed by one of the UBs he crafted in his UB-book and that makes me excited!</p>
<p>What's the message we can get from this exercise? Use the tools: ==static analyzer== (make sure use GCC, it's much superior compared to Clang's as shown in <a href=\"/make-c-safe-again/\">my other post</a>), ==dynamic sanitizer==, and ==Valgrind== if you want to be thorough. The C ecosystem is vast, far and wide...you'd be crazy not leveraging the use of these powerful tools available to you.</p>
<p>There's one particular tool I might cover in the future: <strong>Fil-C</strong>. In my opinion it got the potential to have widespread use because all you need is to recompile your C program using Fil-C (and maybe some minor changes to your codebase) and get a safe C program. This sounds crazy, but watch this space! If Fil-C works well, then there's no need to rewrite C programs in any other language! The only major hurdle is performance, which recompiling using Fil-C would introduce around 2x overhead. The author is targeting for a 1.2x overhead across most use cases.</p>
<p>Imagine how easy and most importantly how scalable it will be to make billions upon billions of lines of C codebase safer by recompiling them using Fil-C..</p>

<p>There are nights, like tonight, that remind me in ways of what it was like when I first moved to the city over 7 years ago. A fresh grad with a salary so low they had to increase the base pay for all entry level employees when minimum wage was raised because it didn't meet the threshold. At that time, I was play acting an adult, waking up each morning and soaking in every new experience with a smile a mile wide at work, spending nights berating myself for being so stupid to believe that I could do <em>this</em>, or anything, for that matter.</p>
<p>Being 21 really is giving yourself permission to be the most dramatic person in your head.</p>
<p>In the blur of all that, I decided to pick up the hobby that I had abandoned at some time between high school and adulthood, but is the reason why I'm here both in a blog sense and in an existence sense. Maybe it was an internet addiction, or maybe it was the distraction of college and shiny new drinks and boys and freedom, but at some point I stopped making things.</p>

<p>It's true that I've been making things my whole life, but my college years are a black hole of abandoned sketchbook and empty promises to myself of making. And maybe if this were a different place or a different post I'd trace a lot of my purposelessness in those years to that misalignment of what I know to be true of myself now, with the privilege of age and retrospect. But, we're here and this is this post.</p>
<p>Back to 2018: I bought myself a sketchbook, something cheap. And spurred by so many factors - knowing only a few people in the city, having barely any money to do anything, living in a tiny room that had a single window that faced a wall across an alleyway - I spent those nights as I find myself spending the night tonight: blasting my Spotify on shuffle for hours, not saying a word, and <em>drawing</em>. Drawing and drawing and drawing, getting drunk in the feeling of it that one blurs into the next until I've lost all sense of time and I need to literally cut myself off.</p>

<em><small>the first ever self portrait I ever drew in that first 2018 sketchbook vs. tonight</small></em></p>
<p>In present day, a comment from a (new-er) friend from my ceramic studio sent me here thinking about all of this. She hadn't known that I drew at all, and when I explained to her that actually drawing is really the thing I love the most, I just get distracted by lots of other things (picture me as the mouse in give a mouse a cookie except the cookie is a new medium or craft). She responded with something that ultimately ended with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's nice to try diff things! and to always have something to go back to</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something to go back to. It reminded me of the permanence of drawing for me, the safety blanket of it. The comfort of pencil on paper, the simplicity. You can't hide in a drawing. I love making physical objects - decorative or functional, but drawing feels personal. Drawing is intimate, every sketchbook a diary of sorts. They are more intrinsically linked with memory for me than any other piece of art in my home, as is true for probably many artists. They are beautiful, and ugly, and perfect, and despicable.</p>
<p>My sketchbook holds the things even my journal is too afraid to keep.</p>
<p>My friend's comment made me <em>miss</em> drawing, as if it was a tangible thing I could hold and feel distant from. It's true, it's hard to have nights like these now with more responsibilities and more interests to balance. But I guess that's the beauty of having something to come back to. It's still waiting for you when you get there.</p>

<p>In the blur of all that, I decided to pick up the hobby that I had abandoned at some time between high school and adulthood, but is the reason why I'm here both in a blog sense and in an existence sense. Maybe it was an internet addiction, or maybe it was the distraction of college and shiny new drinks and boys and freedom, but at some point I stopped making things.</p>

<small><em>our beloved bag dog, Summer, pen, 2022(?)</em></small></p>
<p>It's true that I've been making things my whole life, but my college years are a black hole of abandoned sketchbook and empty promises to myself of making. And maybe if this were a different place or a different post I'd trace a lot of my purposelessness in those years to that misalignment of what I know to be true of myself now, with the privilege of age and retrospect. But, we're here and this is this post.</p>
<p>Back to 2018: I bought myself a sketchbook, something cheap. And spurred by so many factors - knowing only a few people in the city, having barely any money to do anything, living in a tiny room that had a single window that faced a wall across an alleyway - I spent those nights as I find myself spending the night tonight: blasting my Spotify on shuffle for hours, not saying a word, and <em>drawing</em>. Drawing and drawing and drawing, getting drunk in the feeling of it that one blurs into the next until I've lost all sense of time and I need to literally cut myself off.</p>

<em><small>the first ever self portrait I ever drew in that first 2018 sketchbook vs. tonight</small></em></p>
<p>In present day, a comment from a (new-er) friend from my ceramic studio sent me here thinking about all of this. She hadn't known that I drew at all, and when I explained to her that actually drawing is really the thing I love the most, I just get distracted by lots of other things (picture me as the mouse in give a mouse a cookie except the cookie is a new medium or craft). She responded with something that ultimately ended with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's nice to try diff things! and to always have something to go back to</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something to go back to. It reminded me of the permanence of drawing for me, the safety blanket of it. The comfort of pencil on paper, the simplicity. You can't hide in a drawing. I love making physical objects - decorative or functional, but drawing feels personal. Drawing is intimate, every sketchbook a diary of sorts. They are more intrinsically linked with memory for me than any other piece of art in my home, as is true for probably many artists. They are beautiful, and ugly, and perfect, and despicable.</p>
<p>My sketchbook holds the things even my journal is too afraid to keep.</p>
<p>My friend's comment made me <em>miss</em> drawing, as if it was a tangible thing I could hold and feel distant from. It's true, it's hard to have nights like these now with more responsibilities and more interests to balance. But I guess that's the beauty of having something to come back to. It's still waiting for you when you get there.</p>

<p>Howdy everyone! It's been a while since my last blog post since I have been busy dealing with the volatile equity markets due to the reciprocal tariff war launched by US to the whole world. Equity markets were cratering like crazy and it was one of the easiest 50-75% gain from the bottom market in 1 month you'll ever encountered.</p>
<p>Yeah I was so focused wearing my Finance-hat I totally forgot to wear my Writer-hat back. Since then I've scaled out (sold) most of the positions I bought near the bottom of the market and now I'm waiting for the next down-cycle which might take a while.</p>
<p>This waiting time means I'll have spare time to write, yayy!!</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Alright in this post I want to write about the importance of normalizing the resource cost when doing benchmarks. To make it easier to understand, imagine you're ride-testing two cars: first one with 2,500cc engine and it took 10 seconds from 0 to 150 kph.</p>
<p>The second car took much less time, 8 seconds from 0-150 kph, but it requires 7,500cc engine to achieve that. So in order to be 20% faster, it needs 200% increase in engine power.</p>
<p>If we don't normalized the resource cost, it would look as if the Second car wins hands down. But post normalizing, it becomes clear that it is far too costly for us to triple the resources in order to achieve 20% faster performance.</p>
<p>The same concept applies when analyzing levelized cost of electricity of various energy generation methods : solar photo-voltaic, wind farms, hydro, fossil fuels (coal, gas), nuclear, etc. You would be surprised seeing the numbers once we put LCOE in place : nuclear powerplant is the cheapest!</p>
<h3><a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/\">grep</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep\">ripgrep</a></h3>
<p>The tools I'm using to demonstrate the importance of levelizing / normalizing resource cost are grep and ripgrep: both are command line tools to search files for lines containing a pattern match.</p>
<p>I'm inspired by Primeagen livestream where he briefly mentioned something along the lines of: &quot;ripgrep is faster than grep, but also ripgrep uses a lot more cpu&quot;. I was intrigued by this and hence I decided to investigate deeper.</p>
<p>Below are some screenshots of the benchmark I did, pay attention to the CPU used:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Singlethreaded (ST) grep and Multithreaded (MT) ripgrep
<img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/12/01_grep_rg01.png\" alt=\"grep_rg01\" /></p>
</li>
<li><p>Both singlethreaded: ripgrep require the use of <code>-j1</code> flag
<img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/12/grep_rg_01.png\" alt=\"grep_rg-01\" /></p>
</li>
<li><p>Both singlethreaded, for the ripgrep using <code>-uuu</code> flag would yield the same 963 matches.
<img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/12/02_grep_rg02.png\" alt=\"grep_rg02\" /></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay you get the idea: in a levelized / normalized resource usage (set ripgrep thread to 1), in the test I did shows a general picture: yeah ripgrep is fast at default settings, however it also uses a lot more CPU resources. When we normalized the resource usage, it loses it's speed advantage.</p>
<h3>Ripgrep github benchmark</h3>
<p>Now let's visit Ripgrep <a href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep\">github</a>, there are some interesting benchmark numbers we can analyze:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/12/03_grep_rg03.png\" alt=\"03_grep_rg03\" /></p>
<p>Check this <a href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/benchsuite/runs/2022-12-16-archlinux-duff/raw.csv\">github page</a> to see the raw commands used in ripgrep's benchmark.</p>
<p>Did you notice something? None of the commands used <code>-j1</code> flag which is to make ripgrep singlethreaded. Hence the benchmark is not normalized at all, this means grep uses 1 thread, while ripgrep uses multiple threads. This is unfair.</p>
<p>Last screenshot, below I demonstrated using ripgrep both single and multi threaded.
<img src=\"https://freeimghost.net/images/2025/06/12/04_grep_rg04.png\" alt=\"04_grep_rg04\" /></p>
<p>It's a bit messy, let me write the relevant output:</p>
<ul>
<li>ST grep   :  99% cpu 0.170 total</li>
<li>ST grep   :  99% cpu 0.172 total</li>
<li>ST ripgrep:  93% cpu 0.217 total</li>
<li>MT ripgrep: 789% cpu 0.051 total</li>
</ul>
<p>In ST (single threaded), ripgrep is slower (0.217 vs 0.172). In MT (multi threaded) ripgrep is blazzingly fast: 2.4x faster than single threaded grep, however it also uses almost 8 threads in order to achieve that performance vs only 1 thread for grep.</p>
<p>Is that performance worth it? I'll leave the answer to you. Looks like what Primeagen said was true after all!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This post is not an attack to ripgrep or burntsushi, not at all, the purpose of writing the article is to provide insight of how important to levelized / normalized the resource usage of the tools or programs we are using or benchmarking.</p>
<p>I encourage those writing benchmarks to start providing the resource usage data, so we the readers can determine the benchmark is normalized or not. Are you okay with having 2x faster performance at the cost of 8x more resource hungry app?</p>
<p>Someone would argue, ==&quot;having those threads idle / unused is not good either, let's use those idle threads!&quot;== Yes I agree completely with that argument, however if you want to run grep / ripgrep do you close your other apps first (e.g: running Unreal engine, Godot, VScode, Chrome with 20 tabs open 5 of which on Youtube, etc) and then run grep/ripgrep?</p>
<p>Or would you just keep all the apps open and run grep/ripgrep? Exactly my point! Unless all you do is running benchmarks all day, it's very important to measure levelized / normalized resource usage of an app.</p>
<p>For example in my daily usage, I keep 3 workspaces open:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workspace #1: standard office apps, browsers open with 20-30 tabs to do some market research, at least one of them running Bloomberg live market non-stop. Sometimes there are a couple of Youtube videos too.</li>
<li>Workspace #2: trading app (quite heavy coz I'm running an algo trade).</li>
<li>Workspace #3: programming (mostly just terminal and Neovim, but sometimes I run 5-6 Python instances either to scrape data or do some numbers crunching).</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you saying I need to close all of these apps and run ripgrep if I want to do pattern matching on files / directories? No thank you!</p>

I like when people write little blurbs about who this person is and why they're on that list. And chances are, if I like someone's blog, I'll like what they read, too, at least some of it. But that hasn't been as successful as I'd like! It also seems like we Bearblog people are a bit silo'd, since we're mostly consuming other Bearbloggers, but I wouldn't mind breaching out a bit.</p>
<p>So I remembered my <a href=\"tab:https://blog.avas.space/discover\">discover</a> page and went through most of these directories.</p>
<p>I've found I'm really a bit too rigid and not trusting enough. I can't bring myself to just middle-mouse-button-click the top 20 links of some page or filter to open in a New Tab and see what it is about. Instead, something has to pull me in - the name, a brief description, an intriguing design in the screenshot, or the fact that I've seen them around before. I'm less likely to actually go from link to link to link than I'd like to. I'm also suddenly easily overwhelmed by too many tabs open. Yes, I am one of those people that only ever has 1-4 tabs open and immediately closes unneeded ones and reads everything the same day, and I guess I am barely used to deep dives like that anymore (except for university exams). Don't know how to feel about that.</p>
<p>I'm also a bit biased against certain designs, I have to admit. It's not personal, I'm sure those sites are great for whoever they're made for, but if I see a huge &quot;Hi, I'm (name)!&quot; with the handwave emoji, I'm out. I think I've seen this design too many times before, and it also seems to be <em>the</em> standard design for when you want your blog to be a portfolio for your applications in the tech sector. Which is good for you! But not what I am looking for.</p>
<p>There is another type of blog or personal site I've been learning to avoid for myself, and it's ones with way too many columns and boxes. The content is spread out over the entire screen (on desktop) and there's a top bar to click multiple links on, but the most recent post is on the left with a giant picture, then there's other posts on the right, and below that is the latest picture they snapped, next to that is the latest book they read, and right next to that is a link collection of their postroll, and then here are multiple categories with images to quickly signify what they're about... it's all so much! My eyes dart around and I'm unsure what to do next and it feels overloaded and a bit chaotic depending on the execution and sizes. I think I prefer less images, a bit less or no boxes, and a text of links or a list of blog posts to read, centered on the page, with some unused space.</p>
<p>I admittedly have a negative connotation to accompanying posts with a picture and presenting each post as a little box with said image to click on. It reminds me a lot of clickbait, of monetized, SEO-optimized WordPress blogs and engagement at all costs, of old advice that treats your viewers like babies attracted to color. I'm not saying the people who have these kinds of sites that I explored feel that way, but unfortunately that's the message that comes across to me because of my own experiences.</p>
<p>Searching through blogs, many make it too hard to find their RSS feed link. Some of them are broken. With others, it's hard to find an about page, or an easy list of blog posts to get an overview what they talk about.<br />
Many seem to hide when a post was written, which was an inconvenience because I wanted to find out how active the blog is and when the latest post was. No point in following if the last post was 2 years ago, and I wanna know how active you are in general.<br />
Some were also a bit messy in separating the categories (some were both blog posts and notes), others made it unclear visually where a post ends and another begins.</p>
<p>When I see that most of your posts are just about changing the blog design, changing the hosting, changing the delivery method, changing what editor you write the posts in, and all that changes like every 3 months... I am not hopeful that you will ever get to the actual meat of it. Which is fine! Maybe your blog is about testing out all the tools you can use for that and reviewing it. But it just seems like those blogs were not originally set up to do that and instead, they hope to find the ideal conditions until they feel perfect enough to post. I wonder if that state will ever happen, when every tool is presented as the one that finally fits just to also fail as a new shiny thing comes along. I appreciate letting us see under the hood of it all, but I prefer a balance to the blog upkeep posts.</p>
<p>In the end, I think I added about 6-8 new sources to my web reader, many of them magazines and less than I'd like! But I'll keep looking.</p>
<h1>the type of blogs i like</h1>
<p>After criticizing websites, it's only fair to also talk about the positive things I saw and liked.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I really appreciate when you have a doodle-y, self-designed look <a href=\"tab:https://ohhelloana.blog/\">(example)</a>. Not a must, but definitely a bonus.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I like when there's a button for light and dark mode (I have to implement this myself; both light and dark mode are there, but it checks your device/browser setting instead).</p>
</li>
<li><p>It's great when there's an introduction on the landing page or an easy to access About page that quickly lists your personal information (that you're willing to share) and interests and what you're blogging about, maybe already mentioning the different tags and categories you blog about.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I prefer white, black, gray, muted colors and pastel to overly aggressive or neon colors :)</p>
</li>
<li><p>I like blogs that are similar to mine! Some opinions and thoughts, some personal life, even mundane things. Code stuff can be mixed in, but not as the main thing or in a way that is hard to understand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I like when you have a garden section with lots of links to follow, like about yourself, the blog, your interests, postrolls, blogrolls, bookmarks, shrines and more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I like the following topics a lot (not a conclusive list): Zines, Pets, Embroidery, Sewing, Pottery, Beverages (Coffee, Matcha, ...), Observations from the Coffee Shop, University Life, Indie Web, Link Collections, Repairing or modifying the tech you have, Tech Positivity (like <a href=\"tab:https://goodinternetmagazine.com/\">The Good Internet magazine</a>!)</p>

I think I prefer less images, a bit less or no boxes, and a text of links or a list of blog posts to read, centered on the page, with some unused space.</p>
<p>I admittedly have a negative connotation to accompanying posts with a picture and presenting each post as a little box with said image to click on. It reminds me a lot of clickbait, of monetized, SEO-optimized WordPress blogs and engagement at all costs, of old advice that treats your viewers like babies attracted to color. I'm not saying the people who have these kinds of sites that I explored feel that way, but unfortunately that's the message that comes across to me because of my own experiences.</p>
<p>Searching through blogs, many make it too hard to find their RSS feed link. Some of them are broken. With others, it's hard to find an about page, or an easy list of blog posts to get an overview what they talk about.<br />
Many seem to hide when a post was written, which was an inconvenience because I wanted to find out how active the blog is and when the latest post was. No point in following if the last post was 2 years ago, and I wanna know how active you are in general.<br />
Some were also a bit messy in separating the categories (some were both blog posts and notes), others made it unclear visually where a post ends and another begins.</p>
<p>When I see that most of your posts are just about changing the blog design, changing the hosting, changing the delivery method, changing what editor you write the posts in, and all that changes like every 3 months... I am not hopeful that you will ever get to the actual meat of it. Which is fine! Maybe your blog is about testing out all the tools you can use for that and reviewing it. But it just seems like those blogs were not originally set up to do that and instead, they hope to find the ideal conditions until they feel perfect enough to post. I wonder if that state will ever happen, when every tool is presented as the one that finally fits just to also fail as a new shiny thing comes along. I appreciate letting us see under the hood of it all, but I prefer a balance to the blog upkeep posts.</p>
<p>In the end, I think I added about 6-8 new sources to my web reader, many of them magazines and less than I'd like! But I'll keep looking.</p>
<h1>the type of blogs i like</h1>
<p>After criticizing websites, it's only fair to also talk about the positive things I saw and liked.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I really appreciate when you have a doodle-y, self-designed look <a href=\"tab:https://ohhelloana.blog/\">(example)</a>. Not a must, but definitely a bonus.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I like when there's a button for light and dark mode (I have to implement this myself; both light and dark mode are there, but it checks your device/browser setting instead).</p>
</li>
<li><p>It's great when there's an introduction on the landing page or an easy to access About page that quickly lists your personal information (that you're willing to share) and interests and what you're blogging about, maybe already mentioning the different tags and categories you blog about.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I prefer white, black, gray, muted colors and pastel to overly aggressive or neon colors :)</p>
</li>
<li><p>I like blogs that are similar to mine! Some opinions and thoughts, some personal life, even mundane things. Code stuff can be mixed in, but not as the main thing or in a way that is hard to understand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I like when you have a garden section with lots of links to follow, like about yourself, the blog, your interests, postrolls, blogrolls, bookmarks, shrines and more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I like the following topics a lot (not a conclusive list): Zines, Pets, Embroidery, Sewing, Pottery, Beverages (Coffee, Matcha, ...), Observations from the Coffee Shop, University Life, Indie Web, Link Collections, Repairing or modifying the tech you have, Tech Positivity (like <a href=\"tab:https://goodinternetmagazine.com/\">The Good Internet magazine</a>!)</p>

<center style=\"padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;\">This essay is a work of fiction, though inspired by <a href=\"#compulsion-to-catalogue\">my compulsion to self-catalogue</a>.</center></div>

<p>I’m trying to capture myself. I’m not sure when I first got away. I just know that I’ve been gone quite some time.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I started to notice it around age 15. This is when I had my first boyfriend. Craig. I didn’t understand what he wanted from me. I doubt he understood. We both just knew that this was what kids did. We spent our time together watching movies. We would sit on his couch, our thighs touching but nothing more. This was dating.</p>
<p>Monotony crept into our relationship, as monotony is wont to do. We said our goodbyes. We broke up. I didn’t think much of it. I doubt he did.</p>
<p>But I have to say I lost something. Something little had gone. Little, but nonetheless vital. It was like getting a sore on your tongue. It’s such a small, insignificant bump. But you feel it every second of the day. You are reminded by the sharp pain. In my boyfriend or in the movies or in the breakup or in there somewhere I had lost part of myself. But not all of me. Not yet.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’ve had other boyfriends since then. And I’ve lost more and more every time. But it’s not only them. Other things have taken me away.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>At age 17 my grandmother dies. At her funeral, I walk up to the casket. It’s not her. She’s too made-up. So I walk outside and smoke. Across the street I see this dog. A mutt, really. He’s big and brown. Not a pretty brown. A mutt brown. The kind of brown that girls buy hair dye for. He’s sniffing around some weeds. So I call to him. A generic dog call of here boy. This mutt lifts his head and looks left to right. It’s like he’s getting ready to cross the street safely. Just like they tell you in elementary school. He turns his mutt head center and looks at me. His muscles tense and he runs. That happy run that dogs do in movies. The Lassie run. The Benji run. He’s running with that much joy.</p>
<p>Then it comes. A truck. The truck. The only truck to pass down this old Florida road in the past three hours comes. And of course it hits him. Square in the side. And I have to say that took a bigger part of me than any boyfriend ever had.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Little by little I’ve fallen away from myself. People I meet carry pieces of me with them. Like dust on their sleeves. It’s so light they can’t feel it. But I can. I can feel myself disintegrating. I feel my atoms dispersed. I am disappearing.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>When I was five I had a birthday party. My mother took a picture of me blowing out the candles. I have this picture. Being five, I was still building myself. I was gaining pieces little by little, creating the person I’d come to be. That’s what kids are. They are people in the making. They are unfinished character sketches. They are collectors of identity.</p>
<p>I babysat at sixteen. I’d get paid 4 dollars an hour. This one baby I sat every Sunday. Noon to six. Joshua. He was 3 months old. Joshua liked to cry a lot. Being sixteen, I didn’t enjoy this. I’d turn on the TV real loud, trying to drown him out. When he was quiet, I’d cradle him. I’d sing to him.</p>
<p>I visited Joshua when he was five. He didn’t remember me. Of course. He wasn’t even one then. But part of me wondered why. Why I wasn’t remembered. I think that took something out of me. Not being remembered. But who can blame a five-year-old?</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Sometimes I wonder if other people feel it. The parts of them that are missing. Do they feel them leave as I do. Do they look for themselves too. I feel I’ve lost so much already. I’m so behind in picking up.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I wake up early. The sun’s not up. It’s cold in my room. They haven’t turned on the heater. My roommate’s asleep in her bed. Her breath is heavy. We breathe so shallow when we’re awake.</p>
<p>I take a shower. The water’s cold, of course. I’m on the 5th floor. In Iowa. In winter. I cut off the water and reach for my towel. It’s so cold I don’t want to touch the floor.</p>
<p>I step outside. It’s cold. The kind of cold that bites at your skin. That enters your ears. It’s that cold. Then the wind comes. And it’s colder. I can feel it reaching inside me. Clawing down my throat. Tearing at my organs. I can hear it laughing. I know that it’s trying to get me. Get into me. It’s trying to rip out my heart.</p>
<p>So I walk to class. Gasping. Thinking I’ll cough up blood any second. Thinking this is it. Thinking why the hell did I leave Florida. Thinking of that mutt brown dog.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’m working on ways to capture myself. There are several methods and tactics I have used. I created a scrapbook. Page one: here’s little Hailey, age 5, blowing out candles. Caption reads: Hailey wishes to be anywhere but here.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Back in high school in Florida, I was eighteen. I was a senior. I was in AP classes. I had some friends. It was a private school. The only good schools were private. We had to go to chapel. Every Wednesday. It was held in the cafeteria/chapel/wrestling practice room/events room overlooking the lake. The walls were windows behind the preacher. There was a bridge in view. Kids would count how many cars passed during service.</p>
<p>I took a religion class with the priest. We were required to. He told us he used to be a biker. Motorcycles. He used to do drugs. Pot. Heroin. Coke. He told us we could do our homework during chapel. He told us we could sleep. He said if we got in trouble, they would send us to him. And he would let us go. I wondered why he was there at all.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>It’s all these experiences that took me. They’d take a piece and leave their impression. You see, in order to have all these new impressions, new experiences, we have to make room. We have to let go of things. And this is how we disappear.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’m on a date. I’m twenty-two. I’m telling this guy about my theory. Luis is his name. He’s twenty-four. He appears mildly interested. So, where do you think you’re going exactly? He still doesn’t get it. I tell him <em>I’m</em> not going, it’s only parts of me—pieces. Luis is speechless. He lets a minute pass. So, where do you think your pieces are going exactly? He has rephrased.</p>
<p>You see, Luis, I tell him, when you meet people, they change you. When things happen, they change you. And whenever you’re changed, whenever you develop, you are losing something that was there before. We make room for the newness. People influence you. You take their accent. Their way of dressing. Their political opinions. And you have lost yourself. All of a sudden, you are gone. So you have to be careful. You have to catalogue. You have to track. Baby pictures. Journals. Poetry. Everything. You should keep everything, write down everything so that in all of it you can find who you really are and once were.</p>
<p>I realize suddenly that I’ve said too much. I realize suddenly that I should stay away from wine.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>So my scrapbook. Page two: little Hailey on Daddy’s knee. How cute. I can look at this for hours. Who is this person so small. I’ve got to hold onto her. I’ve got to create her life for her with these pictures that I’ve filed away. One day I will build her up so tall that she’ll finally be ready to be.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>When I was six, I learned about death. I had a fish. He was long and slender. Like an eel but smaller. Like a gray swimming earthworm. I named him Max. I loved Max because he wasn’t like the other fish. He swam differently. His eyes were black bubbles on the sides of his head. I always thought they would pop if I touched them.</p>
<p>I loved how Max could bend. He could bend unlike any of the other fish. He was more agile than them. Max was acrobatic. He’d swim in zigzags. He’d twirl. He was graceful and delicate. The other fish just wobbled. Back and forth across the tank they wobbled. Max, on the other hand, flew.</p>
<p>I came home one day to Max performing a backbend. I was astounded. I’d never seen Max do such a thing. His pointy nose was in the gravel, his bubble eyes open wide. His back formed a perfect arch. His belly up. His tail fins in the gravel two inches from his nose. There he was. Incredible. I yelled for my mom to hurry look before he stopped.</p>
<p>Max didn’t stop. My mother came in time. She did not seem as excited as I. Perhaps she’d seen Max do this trick.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>People always say that when people die, they take a part of you with them. This makes me feel understood. What people don’t realize is that when people are born, they take a part of you too.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>When I’m twenty, I’m in the hospital. My best friend is giving birth. Rebecca. She is twenty-one. It was a mistake. She’s sitting there sweating and breathing. Bodies are amazing under physical stress. She’s panting real hard and groaning. Her face is so red. All I can think of is hot coal.</p>
<p>She’s gripping my hand with the unrivaled force of a woman in labor. Her nails dig into my flesh. Hair is stuck to her forehead. She’s in a hospital gown with little blue flowers repeated a million times across it.</p>
<p>The doctor’s sitting on a stool. He’s between Rebecca’s legs. Just looking. He seems rather engrossed in something. Not Rebecca. Something in his head. He decides it’s trivial for the moment and, sighing, tells Rebecca she’ll have to push soon.</p>
<p>She pushes. Each time her hands dig deeper. I’m sure she’ll break the skin. She pushes and groans. Her face turns purple and red. I no longer think of coal. She pushes and throws back her head. Her teeth are clenched. Her face distorted. I do not recognize this colored mass of flesh.</p>
<p>She pushes and it comes. The doctor pulls out a baby. The smallest version of a person. It’s purple and red like its mother. It’s wiggling with eyes closed. The doctor asks if I’d like to cut the cord. Rebecca nods. She cannot let go of me. So the doctor comes to me with this baby and this mess and this cord. So I cut it and feel like a butcher.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>So I have written poetry. Since a child, I’ve written poetry. I used to write for my teachers. Whatever they wanted to hear. They loved it. They all kept it. And I kept writing. I’ve catalogued them now. They’re all in a book. Like my scrapbook. But words instead of pictures.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>My mother hated talking to me. Not everyday talking. Real talking. About life. About love. About death. About sex. She wanted no part of it. My sexual education consisted of the class they taught us in 5th grade. And my cousin reading the definition of sex to me from the encyclopedia when I was four.</p>
<p>When my mother and father decided to separate, my mother did not want to talk. So my father had to. This is how I learned of it.</p>
<p>Hailey, he said, Mother and I are going to separate.</p>
<p>My father was a man of few words. My mother was a woman of none.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’ve made sure to hold onto what I can. I record my voice. I record my thoughts. I journal. I’m sure that if I lay out all my findings, I will be able to see myself. If I combine it all just right, some picture of myself will form.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>One of the biggest pieces I’ve ever lost was to Roger. Roger is my prom date. For senior prom. My mother snaps a picture of us at my house. I have this picture. Roger has dark brown hair. Almost black. He spikes it with gel he gets from Walgreens for $3.99.</p>
<p>It’s warm outside. Humid. The sun is down. We wave goodbye to my mother and get into Roger’s car. Roger is 19. I am 18. I don’t know him very well. He came to my school this year from Georgia.</p>
<p>At the prom I find my friends. We make a group trip to the bathroom. The guys wait patiently. They ask me about the hotel. I don’t know about a hotel. People always go to hotels after prom, they say. I feel rather uninformed. We all apply a layer of lipstick and head out into the dance.</p>
<p>We’d always gone to a friend’s house. Maybe <em>other</em> people had gone to a hotel. Not us, though. We were good kids. I find Roger. What’s this hotel thing I ask him. He seems as surprised as I do and shrugging, asks me to dance.</p>
<p>Roger drops me off at 11pm. We say goodnight. And that was all.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Doubt is what replaces much of what a girl once was. Doubt of looks. Doubt of brains. Doubt of character. Doubt of any and all valuable and lovable traits. Soon a girl is filled with so much doubt she no longer knows anything else. Especially herself.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’m twenty-two again. I’m on a date again. This time it’s Mitchell. I’m watching my wine. I’m listening to him. He’s telling me about his truck. I can’t understand, but I nod. He asks me what I do for fun. I say I’m a collector. He asks me of what. And of course I can’t lie. I tell him of pieces. Of lost pieces. Like broken bottles, he asks me. No of people. Of me, I say. I’m collecting lost pieces of me.</p>
<p>Again silence. Awkward, this hobby of mine. I decide not to elaborate and sip on my wine. Mitchell begins talking about trucks. I nod.</p>
<p>We go on a second date. This time to the movies. My choice. I figure it’s safe. In the dark I can’t talk. Someone else’s story will take up the time. Someone easy to understand. We watch a drama. I can feel my heart pulling itself towards the screen, offering itself to the characters. I close my eyes. Not now. I can’t lose you now.</p>
<p>Mitchell walks me to my door. We kiss goodnight. His truck is running. The exhaust is billowing. He asks when can he see me again.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>My scrapbook. My poems. My journals. My sound bites. All of these catalogued, recorded, and kept. All these files of me. There is a person here.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>My gut is wrenching. I’m digging fingernails into porcelain. My body is heaving. Hair is falling in my face. I’m cradling the toilet. I’m watching all of this. I’m waiting to feel empty.</p>
<p>I come out of the bathroom. Hair is in place. Fingernails intact. I sit down at the table. My friends look up. Welcome back, they say, want dessert?</p>
<p>I smile that I’m-so-bad dessert smile and ask what they have here. Long list of delicacies. We all laugh that we’re-so-bad dessert laugh. We all order something.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Searching for yourself as I do can pass as normal if you’re careful. Everyone has scrapbooks, pictures, old letters, journals. Everyone has their own memorabilia. Mine just happens to be more extensive, my intention more defined, my search far more profound. We are all of us unconsciously searching. I have just woken up.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Back in Florida, I’m watching a horror movie with my boyfriend and his friends. This is a new relationship. I do not know these people. The movie is <em>May</em>. May has no friends. People cannot understand her. May decides to make a friend from the perfect parts of others. She kills them, cuts them up, and sews them together.</p>
<p>Everyone talks about it after. It’s bloody. It’s weird. It’s disturbing. It’s creepy. I say I thought it was funny.</p>
<p>I never hang out with these people again.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Really, I’m just writing an autobiography. Only it’s interactive. Three-dimensional. Alive and growing. It is not static as other book-bound pages are, aging with time and growing out of date. Mine continues on with every day as I slowly collect myself with every minute second moment that arises.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>In 4th grade all the girls made fun of the dark hair on my legs. They laughed at me during music class. They pointed at me in gym.</p>
<p>One night I came into my mother’s room and woke her to ask if I could shave. She sleepily told me yes. I had to remind her in the morning. She found a razor and helped me shave for the first time.</p>
<p>In music class the girls pointed, teasing me for shaving. I stopped, letting my hair grow back. Two weeks later, the girls had begun to shave. Again they laughed at the dark fuzz covering my legs.</p>
<p>This was a game I could not win.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>As a child, things seem to hit harder. But it’s a delayed pain that you feel once you’re older. It hides inside of you for years, just festering and waiting. And you think something’s wrong with your life right then but really it’s just you as a child hurt and waiting for recognition.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>So I’m twenty-one. I’ve babysat since the age of twelve. I’ve seen birth. And I’m pregnant. Not belly-out-pregnant. Yet. It’s brand-new, flat-stomach, no-one-knows-unless–you-tell-them-and-then-they-don’t-even-believe-you-pregnant. This was not intentional.</p>
<p>There begins to be an influx of babies. In the grocery store, on the television, at the mall. I start seeing them everywhere. And their mothers. So loving. So ready. So there for their children.</p>
<p>And there’s me. Frightened. Confused. Already feeling like a murderer. Like a menace to the children I see. Feeling like their mothers should guard them from me.</p>
<p>And then there’s the clinic. White walls. White ceilings. White clipboards with white forms. Who are you and where did you go wrong? Please sign here.</p>
<p>So they drug you. You’re not really asleep but not really awake. And they tell you to relax. And something inside of you dies.</p>
<p>So they put you in a recovery room with the other women. And the drug starts to make you really hot. And there are women around you stripping. Pulling off their gowns, yelling, and moving around the room in a frenzy of sweat and panic. This is a common reaction to the drug, you are told. This is another day at the clinic.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>So I’ve lost so much, you see. Every day. Every second. It’s all falling away from me. But I’m finding it slowly, and pulling it back. You have to see it. You have to see how this works. Just reading this can’t you see? There’s a person here. Can’t you make her out? Construct her, build her, create her from these pieces here, these tokens of a life laid out for you or anyone to paste together and say, “<span class=\"orange-highlight\">I know you.</span>”</p>

<center><h2 id=\"on-revisiting-hailey\" style=\"padding-top:15px; opacity:0.9; font-size:2.2rem\">On Revisiting \"Recollecting Hailey\"</h2></center>

<p>I've been thinking a lot lately about how porous our identities are: how we are shaped by every experience, every person, every bit of information we take in. And how this shaping means losing parts of ourselves...or at least who we would have been without external influences.</p>
<p>I wrote this piece in 2011, but felt myself drawn to revisit it. It pulls on so many of the tangled threads I've been exploring recently: questions of identity; of the <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#June-08-2025-10-21-AM\">devolving influence</a> of <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#May-31-2025-09-41-AM\">social platforms</a>; of <a href=\"/#fn-1\">when I'm &quot;allowed&quot; to call myself an artist</a>, writer; of how my framing and conception of myself shifts so radically depending on <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#June-02-2025-07-10-AM\">which community</a> I'm currently inhabiting; on the constant conflict I feel about what this website itself should be, <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#June-09-2025-09-01-AM\">what</a> should <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#May-22-2025-09-36-AM\">be</a> on it, <a href=\"/changelog/#page-vs-post-etc\">in what form</a>, and what that says about who I am: serious writer? artist? blogger? hobbyist?</p>
<p>In revisiting this piece—which I wrote four years before learning I am Autistic and ADHD—I unearthed a new layer of understanding my own compulsion to self-collect and self-archive. One colored by my neurodivergence and the cost to identity a lifetime of masking can take...</p>
<center><h3 id=\"compulsion-to-catalogue\" style=\"padding-top:15px; opacity:0.9;\">A Compulsion to Self-Catalogue</h3></center>

<p>This essay was borne from my compulsive drive to self-catalogue...a drive itself borne from questions I scrawled in my journal at age seven:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm having a lot of internal problems lately. I can't sort out my feelings or even who I am. I just want to be me. But, I don't know who &quot;me&quot; is. Who would I be if I wasn't under the influence of someone else? What if I had grown up alone? Would I have been a totally different person?<br><br>I know, though, that that would be me. The real, wild, untamed and unchanged me. All I need to do is find me, and maybe then I'll be happy.&quot;<br><br>— <em>journal entry from seven-year-old Emily</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As early as seven, I was concerned about my sense of self being shaped <em>(or, more so, eroded, lost, scattered)</em> by external influences. Some influences enhance, grow, or firm up our sense of self; others take, chip away, and warp. But all of them change us.</p>
<p>This journal entry was written over two decades before I'd learn about <a href= \"/space-taking-defiance/#fn-3\">Autistic masking</a> (or even that I was Autistic). I think we're <em>all</em> shaped, in one way or another, by our experience and encounters—by what we read or take in. But masking can take this to a potentially self-destructive level <em>(a literal destruction of self)</em>.</p>
<p>As an (unknowingly) neurodivergent child, I learned early on to study and approximate what I thought might be expected of me. It was a survival mechanism. It was necessary. It kept me alive. It also cost me a full sense of self. It left (and leaves) me with this unrelenting compulsion to extricate/preserve/form/find my &quot;actual self&quot;.</p>
<p>Much like Hailey, this took form in journaling, scrapbooking, cataloguing...hoping that somehow, if I captured and preserved and archived and tracked...I'd be able to assemble the whole of me. To find her. To hold onto her. To feel tethered, for once, rather than carried away—piece by piece—on the winds of an all-too-overwhelming world not built for brains like mine.</p>

<center style=\"padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;\">This essay is a work of fiction, though inspired by <a href=\"#compulsion-to-catalogue\">my compulsion to self-catalogue</a>.</center></div>

<p>I’m trying to capture myself. I’m not sure when I first got away. I just know that I’ve been gone quite some time.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I started to notice it around age 15. This is when I had my first boyfriend. Craig. I didn’t understand what he wanted from me. I doubt he understood. We both just knew that this was what kids did. We spent our time together watching movies. We would sit on his couch, our thighs touching but nothing more. This was dating.</p>
<p>Monotony crept into our relationship, as monotony is wont to do. We said our goodbyes. We broke up. I didn’t think much of it. I doubt he did.</p>
<p>But I have to say I lost something. Something little had gone. Little, but nonetheless vital. It was like getting a sore on your tongue. It’s such a small, insignificant bump. But you feel it every second of the day. You are reminded by the sharp pain. In my boyfriend or in the movies or in the breakup or in there somewhere I had lost part of myself. But not all of me. Not yet.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’ve had other boyfriends since then. And I’ve lost more and more every time. But it’s not only them. Other things have taken me away.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>At age 17 my grandmother dies. At her funeral, I walk up to the casket. It’s not her. She’s too made-up. So I walk outside and smoke. Across the street I see this dog. A mutt, really. He’s big and brown. Not a pretty brown. A mutt brown. The kind of brown that girls buy hair dye for. He’s sniffing around some weeds. So I call to him. A generic dog call of here boy. This mutt lifts his head and looks left to right. It’s like he’s getting ready to cross the street safely. Just like they tell you in elementary school. He turns his mutt head center and looks at me. His muscles tense and he runs. That happy run that dogs do in movies. The Lassie run. The Benji run. He’s running with that much joy.</p>
<p>Then it comes. A truck. The truck. The only truck to pass down this old Florida road in the past three hours comes. And of course it hits him. Square in the side. And I have to say that took a bigger part of me than any boyfriend ever had.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Little by little I’ve fallen away from myself. People I meet carry pieces of me with them. Like dust on their sleeves. It’s so light they can’t feel it. But I can. I can feel myself disintegrating. I feel my atoms dispersed. I am disappearing.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>When I was five I had a birthday party. My mother took a picture of me blowing out the candles. I have this picture. Being five, I was still building myself. I was gaining pieces little by little, creating the person I’d come to be. That’s what kids are. They are people in the making. They are unfinished character sketches. They are collectors of identity.</p>
<p>I babysat at sixteen. I’d get paid 4 dollars an hour. This one baby I sat every Sunday. Noon to six. Joshua. He was 3 months old. Joshua liked to cry a lot. Being sixteen, I didn’t enjoy this. I’d turn on the TV real loud, trying to drown him out. When he was quiet, I’d cradle him. I’d sing to him.</p>
<p>I visited Joshua when he was five. He didn’t remember me. Of course. He wasn’t even one then. But part of me wondered why. Why I wasn’t remembered. I think that took something out of me. Not being remembered. But who can blame a five-year-old?</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Sometimes I wonder if other people feel it. The parts of them that are missing. Do they feel them leave as I do. Do they look for themselves too. I feel I’ve lost so much already. I’m so behind in picking up.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I wake up early. The sun’s not up. It’s cold in my room. They haven’t turned on the heater. My roommate’s asleep in her bed. Her breath is heavy. We breathe so shallow when we’re awake.</p>
<p>I take a shower. The water’s cold, of course. I’m on the 5th floor. In Iowa. In winter. I cut off the water and reach for my towel. It’s so cold I don’t want to touch the floor.</p>
<p>I step outside. It’s cold. The kind of cold that bites at your skin. That enters your ears. It’s that cold. Then the wind comes. And it’s colder. I can feel it reaching inside me. Clawing down my throat. Tearing at my organs. I can hear it laughing. I know that it’s trying to get me. Get into me. It’s trying to rip out my heart.</p>
<p>So I walk to class. Gasping. Thinking I’ll cough up blood any second. Thinking this is it. Thinking why the hell did I leave Florida. Thinking of that mutt brown dog.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’m working on ways to capture myself. There are several methods and tactics I have used. I created a scrapbook. Page one: here’s little Hailey, age 5, blowing out candles. Caption reads: Hailey wishes to be anywhere but here.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Back in high school in Florida, I was eighteen. I was a senior. I was in AP classes. I had some friends. It was a private school. The only good schools were private. We had to go to chapel. Every Wednesday. It was held in the cafeteria/chapel/wrestling practice room/events room overlooking the lake. The walls were windows behind the preacher. There was a bridge in view. Kids would count how many cars passed during service.</p>
<p>I took a religion class with the priest. We were required to. He told us he used to be a biker. Motorcycles. He used to do drugs. Pot. Heroin. Coke. He told us we could do our homework during chapel. He told us we could sleep. He said if we got in trouble, they would send us to him. And he would let us go. I wondered why he was there at all.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>It’s all these experiences that took me. They’d take a piece and leave their impression. You see, in order to have all these new impressions, new experiences, we have to make room. We have to let go of things. And this is how we disappear.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’m on a date. I’m twenty-two. I’m telling this guy about my theory. Luis is his name. He’s twenty-four. He appears mildly interested. So, where do you think you’re going exactly? He still doesn’t get it. I tell him <em>I’m</em> not going, it’s only parts of me—pieces. Luis is speechless. He lets a minute pass. So, where do you think your pieces are going exactly? He has rephrased.</p>
<p>You see, Luis, I tell him, when you meet people, they change you. When things happen, they change you. And whenever you’re changed, whenever you develop, you are losing something that was there before. We make room for the newness. People influence you. You take their accent. Their way of dressing. Their political opinions. And you have lost yourself. All of a sudden, you are gone. So you have to be careful. You have to catalogue. You have to track. Baby pictures. Journals. Poetry. Everything. You should keep everything, write down everything so that in all of it you can find who you really are and once were.</p>
<p>I realize suddenly that I’ve said too much. I realize suddenly that I should stay away from wine.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>So my scrapbook. Page two: little Hailey on Daddy’s knee. How cute. I can look at this for hours. Who is this person so small. I’ve got to hold onto her. I’ve got to create her life for her with these pictures that I’ve filed away. One day I will build her up so tall that she’ll finally be ready to be.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>When I was six, I learned about death. I had a fish. He was long and slender. Like an eel but smaller. Like a gray swimming earthworm. I named him Max. I loved Max because he wasn’t like the other fish. He swam differently. His eyes were black bubbles on the sides of his head. I always thought they would pop if I touched them.</p>
<p>I loved how Max could bend. He could bend unlike any of the other fish. He was more agile than them. Max was acrobatic. He’d swim in zigzags. He’d twirl. He was graceful and delicate. The other fish just wobbled. Back and forth across the tank they wobbled. Max, on the other hand, flew.</p>
<p>I came home one day to Max performing a backbend. I was astounded. I’d never seen Max do such a thing. His pointy nose was in the gravel, his bubble eyes open wide. His back formed a perfect arch. His belly up. His tail fins in the gravel two inches from his nose. There he was. Incredible. I yelled for my mom to hurry look before he stopped.</p>
<p>Max didn’t stop. My mother came in time. She did not seem as excited as I. Perhaps she’d seen Max do this trick.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>People always say that when people die, they take a part of you with them. This makes me feel understood. What people don’t realize is that when people are born, they take a part of you too.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>When I’m twenty, I’m in the hospital. My best friend is giving birth. Rebecca. She is twenty-one. It was a mistake. She’s sitting there sweating and breathing. Bodies are amazing under physical stress. She’s panting real hard and groaning. Her face is so red. All I can think of is hot coal.</p>
<p>She’s gripping my hand with the unrivaled force of a woman in labor. Her nails dig into my flesh. Hair is stuck to her forehead. She’s in a hospital gown with little blue flowers repeated a million times across it.</p>
<p>The doctor’s sitting on a stool. He’s between Rebecca’s legs. Just looking. He seems rather engrossed in something. Not Rebecca. Something in his head. He decides it’s trivial for the moment and, sighing, tells Rebecca she’ll have to push soon.</p>
<p>She pushes. Each time her hands dig deeper. I’m sure she’ll break the skin. She pushes and groans. Her face turns purple and red. I no longer think of coal. She pushes and throws back her head. Her teeth are clenched. Her face distorted. I do not recognize this colored mass of flesh.</p>
<p>She pushes and it comes. The doctor pulls out a baby. The smallest version of a person. It’s purple and red like its mother. It’s wiggling with eyes closed. The doctor asks if I’d like to cut the cord. Rebecca nods. She cannot let go of me. So the doctor comes to me with this baby and this mess and this cord. So I cut it and feel like a butcher.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>So I have written poetry. Since a child, I’ve written poetry. I used to write for my teachers. Whatever they wanted to hear. They loved it. They all kept it. And I kept writing. I’ve catalogued them now. They’re all in a book. Like my scrapbook. But words instead of pictures.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>My mother hated talking to me. Not everyday talking. Real talking. About life. About love. About death. About sex. She wanted no part of it. My sexual education consisted of the class they taught us in 5th grade. And my cousin reading the definition of sex to me from the encyclopedia when I was four.</p>
<p>When my mother and father decided to separate, my mother did not want to talk. So my father had to. This is how I learned of it.</p>
<p>Hailey, he said, Mother and I are going to separate.</p>
<p>My father was a man of few words. My mother was a woman of none.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’ve made sure to hold onto what I can. I record my voice. I record my thoughts. I journal. I’m sure that if I lay out all my findings, I will be able to see myself. If I combine it all just right, some picture of myself will form.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>One of the biggest pieces I’ve ever lost was to Roger. Roger is my prom date. For senior prom. My mother snaps a picture of us at my house. I have this picture. Roger has dark brown hair. Almost black. He spikes it with gel he gets from Walgreens for $3.99.</p>
<p>It’s warm outside. Humid. The sun is down. We wave goodbye to my mother and get into Roger’s car. Roger is 19. I am 18. I don’t know him very well. He came to my school this year from Georgia.</p>
<p>At the prom I find my friends. We make a group trip to the bathroom. The guys wait patiently. They ask me about the hotel. I don’t know about a hotel. People always go to hotels after prom, they say. I feel rather uninformed. We all apply a layer of lipstick and head out into the dance.</p>
<p>We’d always gone to a friend’s house. Maybe <em>other</em> people had gone to a hotel. Not us, though. We were good kids. I find Roger. What’s this hotel thing I ask him. He seems as surprised as I do and shrugging, asks me to dance.</p>
<p>Roger drops me off at 11pm. We say goodnight. And that was all.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Doubt is what replaces much of what a girl once was. Doubt of looks. Doubt of brains. Doubt of character. Doubt of any and all valuable and lovable traits. Soon a girl is filled with so much doubt she no longer knows anything else. Especially herself.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>I’m twenty-two again. I’m on a date again. This time it’s Mitchell. I’m watching my wine. I’m listening to him. He’s telling me about his truck. I can’t understand, but I nod. He asks me what I do for fun. I say I’m a collector. He asks me of what. And of course I can’t lie. I tell him of pieces. Of lost pieces. Like broken bottles, he asks me. No of people. Of me, I say. I’m collecting lost pieces of me.</p>
<p>Again silence. Awkward, this hobby of mine. I decide not to elaborate and sip on my wine. Mitchell begins talking about trucks. I nod.</p>
<p>We go on a second date. This time to the movies. My choice. I figure it’s safe. In the dark I can’t talk. Someone else’s story will take up the time. Someone easy to understand. We watch a drama. I can feel my heart pulling itself towards the screen, offering itself to the characters. I close my eyes. Not now. I can’t lose you now.</p>
<p>Mitchell walks me to my door. We kiss goodnight. His truck is running. The exhaust is billowing. He asks when can he see me again.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>My scrapbook. My poems. My journals. My sound bites. All of these catalogued, recorded, and kept. All these files of me. There is a person here.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>My gut is wrenching. I’m digging fingernails into porcelain. My body is heaving. Hair is falling in my face. I’m cradling the toilet. I’m watching all of this. I’m waiting to feel empty.</p>
<p>I come out of the bathroom. Hair is in place. Fingernails intact. I sit down at the table. My friends look up. Welcome back, they say, want dessert?</p>
<p>I smile that I’m-so-bad dessert smile and ask what they have here. Long list of delicacies. We all laugh that we’re-so-bad dessert laugh. We all order something.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Searching for yourself as I do can pass as normal if you’re careful. Everyone has scrapbooks, pictures, old letters, journals. Everyone has their own memorabilia. Mine just happens to be more extensive, my intention more defined, my search far more profound. We are all of us unconsciously searching. I have just woken up.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Back in Florida, I’m watching a horror movie with my boyfriend and his friends. This is a new relationship. I do not know these people. The movie is <em>May</em>. May has no friends. People cannot understand her. May decides to make a friend from the perfect parts of others. She kills them, cuts them up, and sews them together.</p>
<p>Everyone talks about it after. It’s bloody. It’s weird. It’s disturbing. It’s creepy. I say I thought it was funny.</p>
<p>I never hang out with these people again.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>Really, I’m just writing an autobiography. Only it’s interactive. Three-dimensional. Alive and growing. It is not static as other book-bound pages are, aging with time and growing out of date. Mine continues on with every day as I slowly collect myself with every minute second moment that arises.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>In 4th grade all the girls made fun of the dark hair on my legs. They laughed at me during music class. They pointed at me in gym.</p>
<p>One night I came into my mother’s room and woke her to ask if I could shave. She sleepily told me yes. I had to remind her in the morning. She found a razor and helped me shave for the first time.</p>
<p>In music class the girls pointed, teasing me for shaving. I stopped, letting my hair grow back. Two weeks later, the girls had begun to shave. Again they laughed at the dark fuzz covering my legs.</p>
<p>This was a game I could not win.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>As a child, things seem to hit harder. But it’s a delayed pain that you feel once you’re older. It hides inside of you for years, just festering and waiting. And you think something’s wrong with your life right then but really it’s just you as a child hurt and waiting for recognition.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>So I’m twenty-one. I’ve babysat since the age of twelve. I’ve seen birth. And I’m pregnant. Not belly-out-pregnant. Yet. It’s brand-new, flat-stomach, no-one-knows-unless–you-tell-them-and-then-they-don’t-even-believe-you-pregnant. This was not intentional.</p>
<p>There begins to be an influx of babies. In the grocery store, on the television, at the mall. I start seeing them everywhere. And their mothers. So loving. So ready. So there for their children.</p>
<p>And there’s me. Frightened. Confused. Already feeling like a murderer. Like a menace to the children I see. Feeling like their mothers should guard them from me.</p>
<p>And then there’s the clinic. White walls. White ceilings. White clipboards with white forms. Who are you and where did you go wrong? Please sign here.</p>
<p>So they drug you. You’re not really asleep but not really awake. And they tell you to relax. And something inside of you dies.</p>
<p>So they put you in a recovery room with the other women. And the drug starts to make you really hot. And there are women around you stripping. Pulling off their gowns, yelling, and moving around the room in a frenzy of sweat and panic. This is a common reaction to the drug, you are told. This is another day at the clinic.</p>
<hr class=\"asterisk\">

<p>So I’ve lost so much, you see. Every day. Every second. It’s all falling away from me. But I’m finding it slowly, and pulling it back. You have to see it. You have to see how this works. Just reading this can’t you see? There’s a person here. Can’t you make her out? Construct her, build her, create her from these pieces here, these tokens of a life laid out for you or anyone to paste together and say, “<span class=\"orange-highlight\">I know you.</span>”</p>

<center><h2 id=\"on-revisiting-hailey\" style=\"padding-top:15px; opacity:0.9; font-size:2.2rem\">On Revisiting \"Recollecting Hailey\"</h2></center>

<p>I've been thinking a lot lately about how porous our identities are: how we are shaped by every experience, every person, every bit of information we take in. And how this shaping means losing parts of ourselves...or at least who we would have been without external influences.</p>
<p>I wrote this piece in 2011, but felt myself drawn to revisit it. It pulls on so many of the tangled threads I've been exploring recently: questions of identity; of the <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#June-08-2025-10-21-AM\">devolving influence</a> of <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#May-31-2025-09-41-AM\">social platforms</a>; of <a href=\"/#fn-1\">when I'm &quot;allowed&quot; to call myself an artist</a>, writer; of how my framing and conception of myself shifts so radically depending on <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#June-02-2025-07-10-AM\">which community</a> I'm currently inhabiting; on the constant conflict I feel about what this website itself should be, <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#June-09-2025-09-01-AM\">what</a> should <a href=\"/feedbackless-feed/#May-22-2025-09-36-AM\">be</a> on it, <a href=\"/changelog/#page-vs-post-etc\">in what form</a>, and what that says about who I am: serious writer? artist? blogger? hobbyist?</p>
<p>In revisiting this piece—which I wrote four years before learning I am Autistic and ADHD—I unearthed a new layer of understanding my own compulsion to self-collect and self-archive. One colored by my neurodivergence and the cost to identity a lifetime of masking can take...</p>
<center><h3 id=\"compulsion-to-catalogue\" style=\"padding-top:15px; opacity:0.9;\">A Compulsion to Self-Catalogue</h3></center>

<p>This essay was borne from my compulsive drive to self-catalogue...a drive itself borne from questions I scrawled in my journal at age seven:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm having a lot of internal problems lately. I can't sort out my feelings or even who I am. I just want to be me. But, I don't know who &quot;me&quot; is. Who would I be if I wasn't under the influence of someone else? What if I had grown up alone? Would I have been a totally different person?<br><br>I know, though, that that would be me. The real, wild, untamed and unchanged me. All I need to do is find me, and maybe then I'll be happy.&quot;<br><br>— <em>journal entry from seven-year-old Emily</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As early as seven, I was concerned about my sense of self being shaped <em>(or, more so, eroded, lost, scattered)</em> by external influences. Some influences enhance, grow, or firm up our sense of self; others take, chip away, and warp. But all of them change us.</p>
<p>This journal entry was written over two decades before I'd learn about <a href= \"/space-taking-defiance/#fn-3\">Autistic masking</a> (or even that I was Autistic). I think we're <em>all</em> shaped, in one way or another, by our experience and encounters—by what we read or take in. But masking can take this to a potentially self-destructive level <em>(a literal destruction of self)</em>.</p>
<p>As an (unknowingly) neurodivergent child, I learned early on to study and approximate what I thought might be expected of me. It was a survival mechanism. It was necessary. It kept me alive. It also cost me a full sense of self. It left (and leaves) me with this unrelenting compulsion to extricate/preserve/form/find my &quot;actual self&quot;.</p>
<p>Much like Hailey, this took form in journaling, scrapbooking, cataloguing...hoping that somehow, if I captured and preserved and archived and tracked...I'd be able to assemble the whole of me. To find her. To hold onto her. To feel tethered, for once, rather than carried away—piece by piece—on the winds of an all-too-overwhelming world not built for brains like mine.</p>

") (link ((href . "https://fromemily.com/recollecting-hailey/") (rel . "alternate"))) (published nil "2025-06-09T19:18:00+00:00"))) ("Chevelle Restoration - Part 6" "<p><a href=\"https://datadiaries.bearblog.dev/chevelle-restoration-part-5/\">Part 5</a></p>
<p>Well we're back with a new instalment of your favourite car restoration project, and while it's been a a few months since the last update, rumours of my demise have been wildly exaggerated!</p>
<p>I ended up spending ludicrous amounts of money on what was supposed to be only a set of imperial wrenches by inadvertently visiting Addendorff Machinery Mart in person, instead of shopping online from the safety and sensibility of my own home. Needless to say, I was pretty eager to put the tools to good use, starting with this beast of a car jack:</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1a-3.webp\" alt=\"1a\" /></p>
<p>The wheels are coming off to send them to get new tyres fitted and to get access to infernal drum brakes yet again. Note the shiny new imperial sockets, ahem!</p>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/datadiaries/1b-2.webp\" alt=\"1b\" /></p>
<p>While I shudder at the mere thought of having to work on the drum brakes, me and them are now on speaking terms after our long and sordid history of disassembly, reassembly and the rinse and repeating thereof. I guess once you've worked on something multiple times you start to develop a Stockholm Syndrome-esque affection for the blasted things.

<p>Well we're back with a new instalment of your favourite car restoration project, and while it's been a a few months since the last update, rumours of my demise have been wildly exaggerated!</p>
<p>I ended up spending ludicrous amounts of money on what was supposed to be only a set of imperial wrenches by inadvertently visiting Addendorff Machinery Mart in person, instead of shopping online from the safety and sensibility of my own home. Needless to say, I was pretty eager to put the tools to good use, starting with this beast of a car jack:</p>

<p>While I shudder at the mere thought of having to work on the drum brakes, me and them are now on speaking terms after our long and sordid history of disassembly, reassembly and the rinse and repeating thereof.

As usual, we reviewed problems we faced in school and discussed how we could improve as teachers.</p>
<p>When we talked about peer influence among students, it led us to ask: How should students be divided into classes? Should we mix students of varying abilities, or should we group them based on proficiency?</p>
<p>The discussion quickly became heated between two teachers: Ms. Tan and Mr. Amir.</p>
<p><br />
<img src=\"https://cdn.vectorstock.com/i/500p/75/97/cartoon-of-two-businessmen-kung-fu-or-karate-vector-20257597.jpg\" alt=\"Fighting between teachers\" />
\\</p>
<p>Ms. Tan said firmly, &quot;Students should be grouped according to their level of ability. It's just practical. Otherwise, only half the class is being engaged. Either the lesson becomes too difficult for lower-proficiency students, or it becomes too boring for students of higher proficiency.&quot;</p>
<p>Almost like a drama show, Mr. Amir raised his voice across the room. &quot;But how will the students feel if they're told they're in the 'slow group'? That's humiliating! Plus, what will the parents say if they see us labeling their children like that? Who will bear the backlash?&quot;</p>
<p>Ms. Tan shot back &quot;I'm not labeling! I'm acknowledging the truth. Not everyone learns at the same pace, and I'm sick of pretending otherwise. If we want results, this is the reality.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not everything is about grades and results!&quot; Mr. Amir fired back. &quot;Students who are already scoring badly have low enough self-esteem. Put them in a 'bad' class, and they'll never believe they're worth anything. Don't you care about these students?&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>Every time this debate plays out, I can’t help but notice that this isn’t just a difference in opinion. It’s a difference in how they <em>think</em>.</p>
<p>From my observations, Ms. Tan is what typology calls a Thinker, and Mr. Amir, a Feeler. While their stances are different, what’s more telling is <em>how</em> they reach their conclusions. That classroom debate isn’t just about policy. It reflects two fundamentally different ways of making decisions.</p>
<p>In a previous post, I wrote about <a href=\"https://josephlee.bearblog.dev/how-do-you-view-the-world-s-n-t-f/\">how we view the world differently</a>. In this one, I want to dive deeper into how we form judgments through <a href=\"https://www.personality.ninja/nxt-core/origin/type-tactic\">Thinking or Feeling</a>.</p>
<p>Understanding this difference can change the way we interact with others. It could be the key for Ms. Tan and Mr. Amir to finally stop fighting and start seeing each other's perspective. And more broadly, it can help improve our relationships by helping us respond more thoughtfully to other people's needs.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Thinker vs. Feeler</h2>
<p>In technical terms, Thinkers make decisions based on logic and reasoning, while Feelers decide based on values and emotional impact. Let’s break that down through five key differences:</p>
<h4>1. Logic-Centered vs. Value-Centered</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinkers ask, “Does this make sense?” They use criteria, premises, and truths to reach conclusions. It’s like solving a math problem. If the numbers line up, it’s probably right.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers ask, “What matters most here?” They weigh emotions, priorities, and how people or themselves might feel affected. Their judgment is guided by what feels important.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: A Thinker and a Feeler might both want the same guitar, but they come from different points of view. The Thinker thinks, <em>“It’s durable, affordable, and has great resale value!”</em> The Feeler says, <em>“It’s beautiful, it looks like Bon Jovi’s, and I can imagine myself playing it every day!”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Evaluates Utility vs. Evaluates Worth</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinkers assess usefulness. <em>“How does this help achieve the goal?”</em> If something or someone isn’t contributing much, they may set it aside.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers assess importance. <em>“Why does this matter to me or others?”</em>
Even if something or someone doesn’t help with the goal, they may value it because it's cherished.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: In a meeting, a Thinker wants to cut a low-performing project that's costing the organization. A Feeler might object and say, <em>“People care about this project. Maybe we can improve it instead.&quot;</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Seeks What Works vs. Seeks What’s Right</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinkers want solutions that get results. They ask, <em>“What’s the most effective or precise way to fix this?”</em> If something works, that’s enough for them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers want solutions that align with personal or shared values. They ask, <em>“Is this the right thing to do?”</em> They care about being true to themselves or about standing together with others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: At work, a Thinker might propose to lay off a senior worker who is no longer as effective as they used to be. A Feeler might push back and say <em>“He’s been fiercely loyal to our company for years. How can we just ditch him like that?”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/v42q4yVH/thinker-vs-feeler.jpg\" alt=\"Thinker vs Feeler Meme\" />
<em>Disclaimer: It's just for laughs. Thinkers and Feelers are way more complex than what two boxes can describe.</em></p>
<h4>4. Solves Problems vs. Nurtures Feelings</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>When trouble shows up, Thinkers jump into fix-it mode. They focus on solving the problem, often setting emotions aside.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers tune in to people’s emotions first. They try to understand and calm hurt feelings, believing that addressing emotions is what solves the bigger issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: A friend struggles with their restaurant business. The Thinker might offer marketing strategies to help, while a Feeler would talk about how their friend feels and attempt to cheer them up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Debates with Reason vs. Persuades with Emotions</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinkers argue by using logic. They say things like, “If this is true, then we should do that,” and expect others to follow the reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers argue by speaking to the heart. They might say, “Imagine how that would make someone feel,” or “This means a lot to me,” hoping to connect on an emotional level.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: In a discussion about school hours, The Thinker might say, <em>“Less stress leads to better focus and learning.”</em> While the Feeler says, <em>“Kids are exhausted. Don’t they deserve time to just be kids?”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Misconceptions</h2>
<p>Before you start jumping to conclusions on who's a Thinker or Feeler in your life, it’s important you understand the common misconceptions. One big misconception is confusing <em><a href=\"https://www.personality.ninja/nxt-core/energy/type-temperament\">temperament</a></em> with <em>function</em>.</p>
<p>People often assume that quiet, receptive individuals must be Feelers, while assertive, direct ones are Thinkers. This assumption likely stems from the idea that logic feels more concrete, whereas emotions seem more fluid. While that may be true to some extent, it doesn’t necessarily determine a person’s overall demeanor.</p>
<p>There’s also the gender stereotype. Men are raised to “think with their heads.” Women are encouraged to “listen to their hearts.” As a result, many men misidentify as Thinkers, and women as Feelers, even when the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Here’s a great read by <em>Personality Ninja</em> on how <a href=\"https://www.personality.ninja/article/thinker-vs-feeler-influence-of-gender-roles\">gender roles distort our perception</a>.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/break-gender-norms-concept_23-2148552118.jpg\" alt=\"Breaking gender roles\" /></p>
<p>Instead of being swayed by temperament or gender roles, try noticing how someone explains their decisions. Do they often weigh logical reasons? Or are they talking about preferences, and what’s liked or disliked by themselves or others?</p>
<p>That small shift in awareness can help you better identify who is truly a Thinker or Feeler without being tricked by surface appearance.</p>
<p>There are plenty more misconceptions I’d like to cover about this dichotomy, but I’ll save that for another post.</p>
<hr />

<p>When we talked about peer influence among students, it led us to ask: How should students be divided into classes? Should we mix students of varying abilities, or should we group them based on proficiency?</p>
<p>The discussion quickly became heated between two teachers: Ms. Tan and Mr. Amir.</p>
<p><br />
<img src=\"https://cdn.vectorstock.com/i/500p/75/97/cartoon-of-two-businessmen-kung-fu-or-karate-vector-20257597.jpg\" alt=\"Fighting between teachers\" />
\\</p>
<p>Ms. Tan said firmly, &quot;Students should be grouped according to their level of ability. It's just practical. Otherwise, only half the class is being engaged. Either the lesson becomes too difficult for lower-proficiency students, or it becomes too boring for students of higher proficiency.&quot;</p>
<p>Almost like a drama show, Mr. Amir raised his voice across the room. &quot;But how will the students feel if they're told they're in the 'slow group'? That's humiliating! Plus, what will the parents say if they see us labeling their children like that? Who will bear the backlash?&quot;</p>
<p>Ms. Tan shot back &quot;I'm not labeling! I'm acknowledging the truth. Not everyone learns at the same pace, and I'm sick of pretending otherwise. If we want results, this is the reality.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not everything is about grades and results!&quot; Mr. Amir fired back. &quot;Students who are already scoring badly have low enough self-esteem. Put them in a 'bad' class, and they'll never believe they're worth anything. Don't you care about these students?&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>Every time this debate plays out, I can’t help but notice that this isn’t just a difference in opinion. It’s a difference in how they <em>think</em>.</p>
<p>From my observations, Ms. Tan is what typology calls a Thinker, and Mr. Amir, a Feeler. While their stances are different, what’s more telling is <em>how</em> they reach their conclusions. That classroom debate isn’t just about policy. It reflects two fundamentally different ways of making decisions.</p>
<p>In a previous post, I wrote about <a href=\"https://josephlee.bearblog.dev/how-do-you-view-the-world-s-n-t-f/\">how we view the world differently</a>. In this one, I want to dive deeper into how we form judgments through <a href=\"https://www.personality.ninja/nxt-core/origin/type-tactic\">Thinking or Feeling</a>.</p>
<p>Understanding this difference can change the way we interact with others. It could be the key for Ms. Tan and Mr. Amir to finally stop fighting and start seeing each other's perspective. And more broadly, it can help improve our relationships by helping us respond more thoughtfully to other people's needs.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Thinker vs. Feeler</h2>
<p>In technical terms, Thinkers make decisions based on logic and reasoning, while Feelers decide based on values and emotional impact. Let’s break that down through five key differences:</p>
<h4>1. Logic-Centered vs. Value-Centered</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinkers ask, “Does this make sense?” They use criteria, premises, and truths to reach conclusions. It’s like solving a math problem. If the numbers line up, it’s probably right.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers ask, “What matters most here?” They weigh emotions, priorities, and how people or themselves might feel affected. Their judgment is guided by what feels important.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: A Thinker and a Feeler might both want the same guitar, but they come from different points of view. The Thinker thinks, <em>“It’s durable, affordable, and has great resale value!”</em> The Feeler says, <em>“It’s beautiful, it looks like Bon Jovi’s, and I can imagine myself playing it every day!”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Evaluates Utility vs. Evaluates Worth</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinkers assess usefulness. <em>“How does this help achieve the goal?”</em> If something or someone isn’t contributing much, they may set it aside.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers assess importance. <em>“Why does this matter to me or others?”</em>
Even if something or someone doesn’t help with the goal, they may value it because it's cherished.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: In a meeting, a Thinker wants to cut a low-performing project that's costing the organization. A Feeler might object and say, <em>“People care about this project. Maybe we can improve it instead.&quot;</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Seeks What Works vs. Seeks What’s Right</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinkers want solutions that get results. They ask, <em>“What’s the most effective or precise way to fix this?”</em> If something works, that’s enough for them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers want solutions that align with personal or shared values. They ask, <em>“Is this the right thing to do?”</em> They care about being true to themselves or about standing together with others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: At work, a Thinker might propose to lay off a senior worker who is no longer as effective as they used to be. A Feeler might push back and say <em>“He’s been fiercely loyal to our company for years. How can we just ditch him like that?”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/v42q4yVH/thinker-vs-feeler.jpg\" alt=\"Thinker vs Feeler Meme\" />
<em>Disclaimer: It's just for laughs. Thinkers and Feelers are way more complex than what two boxes can describe.</em></p>
<h4>4. Solves Problems vs. Nurtures Feelings</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>When trouble shows up, Thinkers jump into fix-it mode. They focus on solving the problem, often setting emotions aside.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers tune in to people’s emotions first. They try to understand and calm hurt feelings, believing that addressing emotions is what solves the bigger issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: A friend struggles with their restaurant business. The Thinker might offer marketing strategies to help, while a Feeler would talk about how their friend feels and attempt to cheer them up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Debates with Reason vs. Persuades with Emotions</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinkers argue by using logic. They say things like, “If this is true, then we should do that,” and expect others to follow the reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feelers argue by speaking to the heart. They might say, “Imagine how that would make someone feel,” or “This means a lot to me,” hoping to connect on an emotional level.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: In a discussion about school hours, The Thinker might say, <em>“Less stress leads to better focus and learning.”</em> While the Feeler says, <em>“Kids are exhausted. Don’t they deserve time to just be kids?”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Misconceptions</h2>
<p>Before you start jumping to conclusions on who's a Thinker or Feeler in your life, it’s important you understand the common misconceptions. One big misconception is confusing <em><a href=\"https://www.personality.ninja/nxt-core/energy/type-temperament\">temperament</a></em> with <em>function</em>.</p>
<p>People often assume that quiet, receptive individuals must be Feelers, while assertive, direct ones are Thinkers. This assumption likely stems from the idea that logic feels more concrete, whereas emotions seem more fluid. While that may be true to some extent, it doesn’t necessarily determine a person’s overall demeanor.</p>
<p>There’s also the gender stereotype. Men are raised to “think with their heads.” Women are encouraged to “listen to their hearts.” As a result, many men misidentify as Thinkers, and women as Feelers, even when the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Here’s a great read by <em>Personality Ninja</em> on how <a href=\"https://www.personality.ninja/article/thinker-vs-feeler-influence-of-gender-roles\">gender roles distort our perception</a>.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/break-gender-norms-concept_23-2148552118.jpg\" alt=\"Breaking gender roles\" /></p>
<p>Instead of being swayed by temperament or gender roles, try noticing how someone explains their decisions. Do they often weigh logical reasons? Or are they talking about preferences, and what’s liked or disliked by themselves or others?</p>
<p>That small shift in awareness can help you better identify who is truly a Thinker or Feeler without being tricked by surface appearance.</p>
<p>There are plenty more misconceptions I’d like to cover about this dichotomy, but I’ll save that for another post.</p>
<hr />
<p>Understanding Thinkers and Feelers isn’t about picking sides. It’s about realizing that we all just see the world from different starting points. And the fact is, both ways of judging are valid and essential.</p>
<p>The more we recognize these differences, the more gracefully we can move through the conflicts, miscommunications, and misunderstandings that inevitably arise in life.</p>
<p>So whether you’re a Thinker learning to be more compassionate, or a Feeler learning to stand your ground with logic, it helps to appreciate the strengths of the other side and learn something valuable from them.</p>

<p>This week note is late, as is my reflection. When you think about it though, what is a week anyway? We shall say it is when YOU decide when your weekdays begin and when your weekend is over. And Tuesday seems to be a day as good as any for a weekend.</p>
<h2>Life</h2>
<p>There was a guilt ridden goodbye to my parent's home where I was an adult-sitter. Eager to resume my normalcy, I flew back to Goa. This normalcy is essential for a greater sense of <em>accountability</em>, which is a concept I held for 10 years and have lost it in the gold mine of free time. Do people not understand how incredibly easy it is to not do anything when the pressure or requirement to do something is only internal? And not &quot;I have to feed myself&quot; internal in the gut but &quot;I must find my life's purpose&quot; internal in the mind, the kind that is supposed to feed your soul. Yes, I say <em>supposed</em>, because you know what also feeds the soul? Doing nothing, wrapped in a cosy throw and serving oneself reheated momos in a sauce that you made in 3 minutes as that is the most you bothered to do for yourself that day.</p>
<p>The other day I was lamenting to Ru that I am hungry, happy-bored, seeking activities like a child in a playschool. This is opposed to my usual mode of sad-bored or happy-busy. What a day it gave me! A <a href=\"tab:https://jigsawnation.com/in/en/?srsltid=AfmBOoo5jrjMRAkhK2jo3XoTXCloz_KNQxeH0jcUQD0X9a12bdi2p5tG\">puzzle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4\">video game</a>, a new mobile game I rediscovered called <a href=\"tab:https://www.ndemiccreations.com/en/22-plague-inc\">Plague Inc</a> where you create a bacteria and spread it across the world. There were 4 meals, and 2 coffees, both delightfully made by other people.</p>
<p>The week began with a pottery class that Smr took me too. What I made is between me, god and the bystanders. What I broke is within me. The whole concept of pottery is fascinating, I feel so human while making things with my own hands, to look at them and know if I tried, I can make a sculpture of my illicit dreams, or an ashtray. The lack of knowledge on how to turn a thought into a real thing, piled on by the lack of focussed teaching in the class has driven me nuts. Currently, I am less talented than the Neanderthals. A potter cannot be too far away from their wheel, and with that I shall return to play, with clay, and make tools and ashtrays that shame smokers who visit me.</p>
<p>In the flight to Mumbai I recognised someone, but as it was before 8AM I opted to omit small talk on both of us.</p>
<h4>So I went to Mumbai</h4>
<p>Many countable hours were spent in Mumbai. A good decision was made to meet a beloved creature, Shre, which was enhanced by the presence of their sister Sne. We were joined by good conversation and gleeful sounds. Bougee cafe near &quot;Pali Hill&quot;, a name I have only before seen in a movie, served good flat white and eggs that Shre did not let me pay for. They bargained with &quot;You can host me when I am in Goa&quot; and I have already made a note in my journal to take this love-revenge on them.</p>
<p>After enjoying reliable eggs, I moved on to meet a rare kind of friend, the <em>work friend</em>, Mo. To see them in the wild, in a new environment, to see how they wear clothes and talk and smile and laugh with me, it was a revelation. It brought me so much joy to share this time with her. Taking a chance at closeness made the trip to Mumbai worth it. Add in a work meeting, and I had a justified extravagance. Mo and I also met our ex-department head and another colleague. And it is with great pleasure that I announce, no they did not remember me. So I felt &quot;fuck it&quot; and left them with a memory of me recounting at least one Haryana centric female infanticide joke.</p>
<p>A surprising new learning was that I am not suited to meet English people, as I am brimming with colonialism jibes and remarks. They cannot even be called jokes. Certainly there was a real attempt at feeling guilt about such a behaviour, but like men on first dates, it is all inauthentic.</p>
<p>Mumbai opened my eyes to fashionable bags, which I saw everywhere. Within hours of reaching Mumbai, I was craving something that said &quot;Cavalli&quot; in bold letters.</p>
<h4>Work is worship lol</h4>
<p>Case studies, a new website landing page, an &quot;imma cool girl&quot; vibe but balanced with professionalism, these have been my accomplishments on the work front.</p>
<h2>Culture consumption</h2>
<p><a href=\"tab:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60410002-we-all-want-impossible-things\">We all want impossible things</a> was a meaningful book to read. It might seem too sad, the C (cancer) word is a premise, but essentially it is about two friends. As I only read it in public spaces, I could not escape tears. My throat was choked several times, and the traumatic meal from Popeye's Chicken was not the lone cause. The book did not resemble any kind of trauma porn. It was a beautiful, simple story that felt real and I was unsurprised to learn it was based on the author's own experiences.</p>
<p>No movies this week. Aren't I a rebel without a cause?</p>
<p>There is a fellow on Youtube who <a href=\"tab:https://www.youtube.com/@SittingHereReading\">reads books, by himself, on video</a>. No this is not a popular channel. No this is probably not making him any money. Yes it is shameful to think one would use these platforms only to profit.</p>
<p>The song Psycho Killer by Talking Heads was released in 1977. The <a href=\"tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ54eImz88w\">official video</a> was released four days ago. It is easy to relate to the video. Even I could find resemblance in a time where I cried out to Ru &quot;if I have to speak to a single client, I might stab myself in the eye&quot;. This song gets a mention as I have been recognising it whenever, wherever it plays, in film or tv. My recognition began with <a href=\"tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnVvBELqD3M\">this scene</a> in Mindhunter, a solid way to end an episode and declare the weight of all there is to come for these characters. So I thought to note a few notable mentions of this scenes that made me go &quot;its the song its the song!&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>During the <a href=\"tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl0w3c4QJRQ\">Son of Sam game</a> in season 2 of Only Murders in the Building. The OMITB opening track by Siddhartha Khosla is still my ringtone.</li>
<li>In Stranger Things season 4, when the high school jock character <a href=\"tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjlkWlVX14\">riles people up to fight for justice</a>, the score gives a perfect wink to who he could become.</li>
<li><a href=\"tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyE05Laf8Zg\">Damon Salvatore</a> in The Vampire Diaries, and it is a confusing moment for a young person (me) to see a sexy vampire (Damon) draining blood from another man (could be me?).</li>

") (link ((href . "https://stateofnats.bearblog.dev/the-state-of-nats-4-it-is-here-again/") (rel . "alternate"))) (published nil "2025-06-10T12:24:00+00:00"))) ("is blogging romantic?" "<p>I wondered recently how I would romanticize<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> blogging, and if I actually already do. I took an (admittedly shorter than I anticipated) hiatus to come back when blogging calls me again, and during that time, I missed it and I read pieces by others that reminded me again what it means to me.</p>
<p>What came to mind first was the idealization of solitude. Self-reflection, keeping oneself occupied, and intentional space to think and sort your thoughts. Reminds me of the movie image of a character wearing headphones or typing away at a laptop on their own - they’re usually more shy, or a loner, mysterious, in thought, or going through something. They’re in their own head and don’t want to be approached and ripped out of their own thoughts.</p>
<p>I think making something pretty belongs to romanticizing something nowadays. If done at a desk, I think of making it cozy and maybe a little aesthetic. Tidying it up, getting a nice beverage, turning on fairy lights or lighting a candle. Preparing some snacks. Kind of like preparing for a study session, now that I think about it. You could imagine being the main character in some movie or music video - you’re Carrie Bradshaw or Andy Sachs typing away on your laptop.</p>
<p>There’s also the idea of a digital keepsake, a time capsule, a diary with more design opportunities and an audience. Feeling like being part of something bigger by doing something that may survive you, imagining how people will find it after your death. I imagine my blog like a heartshaped locket necklace and my blog posts are in the locket.</p>
<p>It’s also enabling us to romanticize other, unrelated aspects of life. A normal day becomes more special by shining the spotlight on a very small aspect of it and imbuing it with some meaning in a post.

<p>Romanticism prioritized subjectivity and emotional authenticity over reason and objectivity. Blogging that’s personal and reflective (and not just how-to’s, portfolios or commercial) does this by offering a medium to express your inner life, thoughts, dreams, and struggles with a sort of intimacy and rawness that traditional publications and social media personalities lack. There’s a sort of “valorization”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\">3</a></sup> of the everyday and the mundane. Yes, technically you can find that all over the net via a million “Get Ready With Me” “What I Eat In A Day” “Outfit Of The Day” “What’s In My Bag”, but somehow those just feel performative, empty, consumerist. When people arrive on Bearblog and read the Discover section, many seem to comment how intimate and authentic the posts feel, enjoying reading mundane day reflections and week notes of others and connecting over it.</p>
<p>I also see a parallel between Romanticism as a reaction to industrialization, and (the return to) blogging as a reaction to mass media, the corporate internet, and homogenized social media platforms. Blogs often celebrate niche interests, alternative lifestyles, or personal struggles that resist the “flattening” of human experience into metrics and commodification via virality.</p>
<p>Then also, blogging in more minimalist ways (like Bearblog) without ads and popup banners and newsletter modals feels more organic, a kind of original expression not filtered through editorial constraints and SEO optimizations. To me, it could resemble the Romantic longing for authentic, unspoiled experience, for lost innocence, for nature, for the past and a return to the natural and the immediate. I recognize this whenever some people choose to talk about it in terms of <em>returning</em> to a simpler, older web and indulging in nostalgia, even in design.</p>
<p>What about the the Romantic ideal of the solitary (genius) artist that is misunderstood by society but in touch with deeper truths and their own feelings? That may be something some bloggers relate to: their role as observers, outsiders, or truth-tellers, writing outside the bounds of institutions (here: containerized social media), motivated by personal vision rather than profit, and unbound by popular taste.

<p>Even the writing style and metaphors are a little romantic at times - “My little corner/nook of the web” “My quiet sanctuary” “My personal space” “Welcome to my digital garden” “From my heart to yours”; descriptions of a mind “wandering”, descriptions of pages of a website or blog as rooms, posts as letters. But especially when there is an emphasis on nature, landscapes, growth and plants :)</p>
<p>What’s blogging on the personal web within the indieweb, if not speaking your truth, resisting conformity, and making meaning through beauty, emotion, and imagination? All in the face of the alienating modernity of social media profiles and slick, impersonal websites for businesses?</p>

(updated nil "2025-06-10T19:53:00+00:00") (author nil (name nil "avas") (email nil "hidden")) (content ((type . "html")) "<p>I wondered recently how I would romanticize<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> blogging, and if I actually already do. I took an (admittedly shorter than I anticipated) hiatus to come back when blogging calls me again, and during that time, I missed it and I read pieces by others that reminded me again what it means to me.</p>
<p>What came to mind first was the idealization of solitude. Self-reflection, keeping oneself occupied, and intentional space to think and sort your thoughts. Reminds me of the movie image of a character wearing headphones or typing away at a laptop on their own - they’re usually more shy, or a loner, mysterious, in thought, or going through something. They’re in their own head and don’t want to be approached and ripped out of their own thoughts.</p>
<p>I think making something pretty belongs to romanticizing something nowadays. If done at a desk, I think of making it cozy and maybe a little aesthetic. Tidying it up, getting a nice beverage, turning on fairy lights or lighting a candle. Preparing some snacks. Kind of like preparing for a study session, now that I think about it. You could imagine being the main character in some movie or music video - you’re Carrie Bradshaw or Andy Sachs typing away on your laptop.</p>
<p>There’s also the idea of a digital keepsake, a time capsule, a diary with more design opportunities and an audience. Feeling like being part of something bigger by doing something that may survive you, imagining how people will find it after your death. I imagine my blog like a heartshaped locket necklace and my blog posts are in the locket.</p>
<p>It’s also enabling us to romanticize other, unrelated aspects of life. A normal day becomes more special by shining the spotlight on a very small aspect of it and imbuing it with some meaning in a post. Something about the meal you cooked evolving into a story about your family home; posts feeling like you’re sending out a whisper into the forest and waiting to hear something back.</p>
<p>That led me to the actual topic: How would blogging fit into Romanticism<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\">2</a></sup>? Is blogging romantic in that sense?</p>

<p>I’m trans. I’ve changed my body, my voice, my entire freaking life because not doing so would’ve eventually killed me. I didn’t choose this path to make a statement or escape misogyny. I chose it because I needed to survive. Because this is the only way I can exist and still be able to breathe.</p>
<p>But the version of “trans” I see celebrated online doesn’t look anything like the life I’ve built. What I see now is a word that’s been stretched beyond all recognition; used as an aesthetic, a non conforming political gesture. And the people who use it that way? They’ve never stared down the barrel of this identity the way I have.</p>
<p>Being trans, for me, is a risk. I have an invisible target tattoed on my back. It’s being clocked in public. It’s walking into a bathroom or changing room and preparing for confrontation. It’s feeling my heart rate spike every time a stranger’s eyes linger just a little <em>too</em> long. It’s the fear of losing my job, my home, my family, and any safety net I might have. If someone ever decides “you look wrong” it wouldn’t just mean a bad day, <strong>it could cost me my life.</strong></p>
<p>People who call themselves trans but <em>choose</em> to <em>never</em> transition socially, emotionally, physically or medically don’t carry that same weight. And I’m tired of pretending that’s not a huge difference in experience and meaning.</p>
<p>If you haven’t faced dysphoria…<br />
If you haven’t fought to change your body, your voice, your documents and your name, or how the world physically sees you…<br />
If you haven’t risked safety, comfort, or stability just to live a day as yourself…<br />
Then you’re not walking the same road I am.</p>
<p><em>And that’s not hate. That’s just fucking reality.</em></p>
<p>I don’t have anything against people who are questioning, exploring, or playing with gender. That’s their business. They’re free to do as they like, who am I to say they can’t or shouldn’t? But I refuse to let that version of “trans” erase mine. Because I’m not some aesthetic variation. I’m a binary man who has bled, cried, screamed, fought, and rebuilt himself. And when people like me try to speak? We’re silenced. Called transphobic or anti-woke. Told we’re gatekeeping and to be quiet while those who’ve never paid the price get to define the entire experience and speak for us. Speak over us.</p>
<p>There should be a word for what I am.<br />
And maybe it used to be “trans.”<br />
But I’m not sure anymore.</p>
<p>All I know is I didn’t get here by swapping out pronoun pins.</p>
<p>I got here by fighting tooth and nail, with a syringe and a vial.</p>

"<p>I have been watching the protests in Los Angeles from my vacation in New Orleans and I just wanted to take this opportunity to say that Los Angeles is a great, peaceful place to live, and that I like it there very much.</p>
<p>Many people who have moved to LA experience a phenomenon where relatives from other places will see outrageous claims about LA in the news and automatically believe them. It's a place that is very easy to lie about, partially because it is so enormous... and partially because &quot;LA is dangerous&quot; is one of those things people are willing to believe without evidence.</p>
<p>I'm not the first person to say this, but the things people are willing to believe without evidence always paint a super clear picture of their desires. Whose suffering are they hungry to see? Whose subjugation would make them happy? What simple and easy morality-play stories do they long to see acted out in the world around them?</p>
<p>The thing about mass protest, however, is that people mostly participate in it because it doesn't seem particularly dangerous to them. Sure, everyone knows things could go south... but when thousands and thousands of people my age - with lots to lose - show up at a protest, it's because the risk made sense to them.</p>
<p>I'm queuing this one up early on the evening of the 8th, all the way on the other side of the country, agitated that I can't be there or see any of this for myself.

<p>Many people who have moved to LA experience a phenomenon where relatives from other places will see outrageous claims about LA in the news and automatically believe them. It's a place that is very easy to lie about, partially because it is so enormous... and partially because &quot;LA is dangerous&quot; is one of those things people are willing to believe without evidence.</p>
<p>I'm not the first person to say this, but the things people are willing to believe without evidence always paint a super clear picture of their desires. Whose suffering are they hungry to see? Whose subjugation would make them happy? What simple and easy morality-play stories do they long to see acted out in the world around them?</p>
<p>The thing about mass protest, however, is that people mostly participate in it because it doesn't seem particularly dangerous to them.

<p><em>Part of a blog bandwagon started by <a href=\"https://rolltodoubt.wordpress.com/2025/06/12/how-i-prep/\">Weird Writer</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Preamble and Rant</h2>
<p>Prep is a journey, not a destination. Every campaign teaches you something new to borrow, bend, or break.</p>
<p>During the last decade I ricocheted between two unhealthy extremes: zero-prep improv and galaxy-brain over-prep. Pure improv let me spin up a one-shot in minutes—but the well ran dry just as fast. Hyper-detailed VTT prep, on the other hand, turned me into a one-person video-game studio. Sessions slipped, anxiety spiked, and I quit the hobby for almost two years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Perfection is the enemy of good.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These struggles are mine, yet I hear the similar frustrations every day online. Theory points the way, but only practice tells you what fits.</p>
<p>What follows is the prep style that helped me to finally let me run a game on short notice without scrambling or surrendering to chaos. The world ticks on with or without the players, and—two-and-a-half years in—I still can't wait for the next session. Is it perfect? No. Would I start differently today? Absolutely. Am I having fun? You bet.</p>
<h2>Prep Goals</h2>
<p>Before launching the campaign I set three guiding objectives:</p>
<h4>A Consistent, Player-Independent World</h4>
<p>I wanted a setting that exists regardless of who is at the table. Multiple parties can roam the same map and their actions leave lasting marks—without me rewriting reality to cater to a single group.</p>
<h4>Low-Prep Sessions</h4>
<p>Session prep should take minutes, not hours. I'd already burned out once on elaborate VTT builds; this time I wanted to show up excited, not exhausted.</p>
<h4>Redirect Energy Into Creation</h4>
<p>If the next session requires little work, I can pour surplus energy into optional legwork—fleshing out locations, and create new bespoke ones because it's fun, not because a deadline is looming.</p>
<h2>Pre-Campaign Prep</h2>
<p>My current game is set in Dolmenwood, a published sandbox with a rich, detailed region. Whether you adopt an existing setting or create your own, the first step is the same: establish good baseline familiarity.</p>
<p>Because Dolmenwood already supplies the content, my job was to absorb it. I skipped rules and player options and dove straight into the hexes, annotating as I went. At one point I even built an Obsidian vault, transcribing every entry into a linked wiki. That was... overkill. Typing soothed my brain, but I almost never referenced those files. The PDFs' built-in hyperlinks plus a good reader app covered 95% of what I needed.</p>
<p>That deep dive did have one major benefit: typing and annotating the text forced me to explore the setting on my own terms. Encountering factions or NPCs I'd never noticed ignited my curiosity, leading me to dive into sidebars on towns, history, and lore. Ultimately, the exercise built a rock-solid baseline understanding—one you can also achieve simply by reading attentively and jotting down notes or questions as they arise.</p>
<p>Crucially, I did not wait until the entire book was internalised to start play. I kicked things off with a half-finished note pile and filled the gaps between the first sessions. That feedback loop kept perfectionism at bay and turned prep into fuel rather than friction.</p>
<h2>Session Prep</h2>
<p>My ambition was near-zero session prep, so I could show up relaxed and focus on play. A broad grasp of Dolmenwood gave me confidence, but procedures turned that knowledge into action—especially since this was my first serious plunge into OSR-style, player-driven gaming. The three practices below finally freed me from session-prep anxiety.</p>
<h4>Prepping Tools</h4>
<p>Random encounters are my favorite especially coupled with the evocative prompts from Dolmenwood's Monster Book, yet rolling fresh tables mid-session stalls momentum. My first workaround was to pre-roll results onto index cards. Players drew a number and I flipped the card—quick, but still imperfect: I already knew the whole deck, so surprise dulled over time and the cards were fussy to manage.</p>
<p>Everything clicked after I read <a href=\"https://www.paperspencils.com/prep-tools-not-adventures/\">Nick LS Whelan's &quot;Prep Tools, Not Adventures&quot;</a> and watched <a href=\"https://riseupcomus.blogspot.com/2023/06/the-dolmenwood-overloaded-encounter.html\">Josh at Rise Up Comus use Perchance generators in his Dolmenwood game</a>. A fellow tinkerer (sicko), I spent some time building my own suite:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://perchance.org/dolmenwood-crawl-generator\">Dolmenwood Crawl Generator</a></li>
<li><a href=\"https://perchance.org/dw-items\">Dolmenwood Items Generator</a></li>
<li><a href=\"https://perchance.org/dw-npc\">Dolmenwood NPC Generator</a></li>
<li><a href=\"https://perchance.org/dw-all-names\">Dolmenwood Names Generator</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/elmcat/dwencounters.webp\" alt=\"Sample output from the Crawl Generator\" /></p>
<div class=\"img-desc\"><center>Sample output from the Crawl Generator—just enough detail to let me improvise everything else on the fly!</center></div>

<p>To keep results vivid, I later wrote &quot;<a href=\"https://elmc.at/expanded-bestiary-ants-bats-and-bears/\">expanded</a> <a href=\"https://elmc.at/expanded-bestiary-boars-catfish-and-primates/\">bestiary</a>&quot; posts—each one a handful of encounters fleshed out with Monster-Book-style prompts, though, most are only found in the generator. The whole project took weeks, but the payoff was huge: wilderness exploration now runs on rails I can't see ahead of time, so I stay just as surprised as the players.</p>
<h4>Prepping Generative Procedures</h4>
<p>I also implemented <a href=\"https://elmc.at/how-to-set-up-and-use-faction-turns/\">faction turns</a>—Mausritter-inspired procedural events that advance Dolmenwood's narrative outside of sessions. Once again I delved into the source material, paying close attention to small details and reading between the lines to <a href=\"https://elmc.at/dolmenwood-factions-index/\">extrapolate content for each faction</a>. Because these turns recur on a schedule, each roll gradually reshapes the world and inevitably intersects with the PCs. The longer the campaign runs—and the more the players engage with the factions—the richer the pool of story hooks becomes. It's working beautifully and ensures I never run out of ideas.</p>
<p>Rarer, lesser-known events arise from a table of <a href=\"https://elmc.at/against-the-elements/\">natural disasters</a>, ready to throw a wrench into everyone's plans and cause havoc. I'm still waiting for a major catastrophe, but I'm eager to explore the consequences—and to see how the players exploit the chaos!</p>
<h4>Calendars</h4>
<p>Finally, <a href=\"https://elmc.at/calendar-chronicles/\">I fully committed to a campaign-calendar system</a>—recording every world-action event: faction turns, loose-thread resolutions, random-event rolls, and more. In-game time advances at three distinct speeds, depending on what the party is doing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adventure mode:</strong> Time crawls. Often several sessions cover a single in-game day.</li>
<li><strong>Travel / <a href=\"https://elmc.at/sandbox-settlements-prep-run-and-thrive/\">settlement mode</a>:</strong> Time marches. Up to a few days pass each session.</li>
<li><strong><a href=\"https://elmc.at/sandbox-settlements-downtime/\">Downtime</a>:</strong> Time accelerates. Usually a week per session, ensuring at least one faction turn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because every event has a date stamp, I always know exactly when something must be resolved—nothing gets forgotten, and my focus stays sharp. Resolution itself is fast—just a handful of rolls—and I don't have to do it every session; sometimes several real-world weeks go by before the calendar needs attention again.</p>
<p>All this means session prep now takes ten minutes or less: open the tools, skim calendar notes, jot a couple of &quot;maybe&quot; ideas—if at all, and I'm good to go.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end, I invest a great deal of time upfront—but all that work goes into reusable tools and procedures that give me confidence and efficiency. At this point, I barely think of it as prep; it's more like a solo world-building lab that generates new content organically. That frees me to focus on crafting locations, fleshing out settlements, and creating bespoke Dolmenwood dungeons—without the stress of pre-session anxiety.</p>
